Contributing to Geant4
=====
To contribute patches to Geant4, users can submit normal GitHub Pull Requests (PR) such that:

- A single PR refers to a single particular topic (fix or suggested enhancement);
  PRs including uncorrelated changes in codes in different areas or modules will
  not be considered.

A PR will be examined by a responsible and eventually extracted for a patch in
the development repository of Geant4, to be included in a future release or
patch.

For simple bug-fixes, it is still recommended to use the official Bugzilla problem reporting system
to report the issue, linking back to the Pull Request if created:

- Problem reports: `Bugzilla problem reporting system <https://bugzilla-geant4.kek.jp>`_.

Questions on Geant4 itself or feature requests should be made through our `User Forum <https://geant4-forum.web.cern.ch>`_,
and `full documentation on use of the toolkit is online <https://cern.ch/geant4/support/user_documentation>`_.
