# Getting Geant4Py and ZMQ Environments

To enable better support and development of the Geant4Py and ZMQ environments for
end users, the distribution and build of these as part of the Geant4 toolkit has
been removed in Geant4 11.1.

Both codes are still available from the original and ongoing upstream development
repositories on GitHub:

- [Geant4Py](https://github.com/koichi-murakami/g4python)
- [ZMQ](https://github.com/koichi-murakami/zmq-geant4)

All support enquiries and questions should be directed to the Issues boards on
those projects.
