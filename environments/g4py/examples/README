This directory contains a set of examples for Geant4Py.

[demos/water_phantom]
An example of "water phantom dosimetry"

This demo program shows that a Geant4 application well coworks with ROOT 
on Python front end. VisManager, PrimaryGeneratorAction, UserAction-s, 
histogramming with ROOT are implemented in Python;
  + dose calculation in a water phantom
  + Python overloading of user actions
  + on-line histogramming with ROOT
  + visualization


[education]
Educational examples with Graphical User Interface using TKinter

* lesson1
The first version of the courseware of the mass attenuation coefficient.

* lesson2
GUI interface of ExN03, which can control geometry configuration,
intial particle condition, physics processes, cut value, 
magnetic field and visualization outputs.

[emplot]
Examples of plotting photon cross sections and stopping powers with ROOT

[gdml]
Examples of writing/reading user's geometry to/from a GDML file
