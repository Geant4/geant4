Geant4Py

  Geant4Py is a set of python modules for using Geant4.

==========================================================================

http://www-geant4.kek.jp/projects/Geant4Py/


System Requirements:
-------------------
Python
  - only 2.x is tested.

Geant4
  - 8.0 or later
  - should be built in "global" and "shared" libraries.
  - All header files should be collected into $(G4INSTALL)/include
    by "make includes"

CLHEP
  - 1.9.1.1 or later
  - should be built in shared library.
  - Building shared objects is supported since version 1.9.

BOOST-Python
  - version 1.32 or later

(Optional)
ROOT

Before Starting:
----------------
In dafault situation, Geant4 creates and uses "granular static libraries".
But, the Python interface requires "global shared library".
If you donot build your Geant4 libraries in global shared mode, 
you have to recreate your instance additionally.

In "tools" directory, you can find some ways to handle both "glanular static"
and "global shared" environments. Please take a look.


How to Install:
---------------
There is a configuraton script for building the package.

# ./configure --help 

`configure' configures Geant4Py to adapt to many kinds of systems.

Usage:  ./configure SYSTEM [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...

SYSTEM: System type (see Supported Arhitectures)

Options:
  -h, --help                Display this help and exit

Installation directories:
  --prefix=PREFIX           Installation prefix  [./]
  --libdir=DIR              Python modules installaion dir [PREFIX/lib]
  --incdir=DIR              Header installaion dir [PREFIX/include]

Fine tuning of the library path:
  --with-g4-incdir=DIR      Geant4 header dir [$G4INCLUDE]
  --with-g4-libdir=DIR      Geant4 library dir [$G4LIB/$G4SYSTEM]
  --with-clhep-incdir=DIR   CLHEP header dir [$CLHEP_INCLUDE_DIR]
  --with-clhep-libdir=DIR   CLHEP library dir [$CLHEP_LIB_DIR]
  --with-clhep-lib=LIB      library name of libCLHEP.so [CLHEP|$CLHEP_LIB]

  --with-python-incdir=DIR  Python header dir [/usr/include/python],
                            (location of pyconfig.h)
  --with-python-libdir=DIR  Python library dir [/usr/lib]

  --with-boost-incdir=DIR   BOOST-C++ header dir [/usr/include],
                            (location of boost/)
  --with-boost-libdir=DIR   BOOST-C++ library dir [/usr/lib]
  --with-boost-python-lib=LIB library name of libboost_python.so [boost_python]

  --with-package-dir=DIR    Geant4 Package dir

  --with-gdml-incdir=DIR    GDML header dir
  --with-gdml-libdir=DIR    GDML library dir

  --with-xercesc-incdir=DIR Xerces-C header dir [/usr/include]
  --with-xercesc-libdir=DIR Xerces-C library dir [/usr/lib]

Enable/disable options: prefix with either --enable- or --disable-
  openglx      OpenGLX support    [auto]
  openglxm     OpenGLXm support   [disable, $G4VIS_USE_OPENGLXM]
  raytracerx   RayTracerX support [disable, $G4VIS_USE_RAYTRACERX]
  gdml         GDML support (external, experimental) [disable]
               also specifying inc/lib directories

Supported Architectures:
  linux           for Linux gcc 3.x and 4.x
  linuxx8664gcc   for AMD Opteron and Intel EM64T Linux gcc 3.x and 4.x
  macosx          for MacOSX with gcc (Tiger/Leopard and Xcode)

You can specify all parameters adopting your environment.

For example, 
# ./configure linux 
  --with-g4-incdir=/opt/heplib/Geant4/geant4.8.1/include 
  --with-g4-libdir=/opt/heplib/Geant4/geant4.8.1/slib/Linux-g++ 
  --with-clhep-incdir=/opt/heplib/CLHEP/2.0.2.2/include 
  --with-clhep-libdir=/opt/heplib/CLHEP/2.0.2.2/lib 
  --with-clhep-lib=CLHEP-2.0.2.2

The configuration script will create config/config.gmk, which describes 
your envrionment.

After executing the configure script, then 

# make
# make install

That's all!

How to Use:
-----------
Some environment variables are required at run time.

* PYTHONPATH
Python module search directories, given by a colon-separated list 
of directories. 
Practically, $(INSTALL_PATH)/lib is ok.

* LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Additional shared library path to be searched.

Some libraries paths are already specified via "-rpath" linker option, 
so these paths do not have to be added to "LD_LIBRARY_PATH".
 * Geant4
 * CLHEP
 * Boost
 * $(INSTALL_PATH)/lib
 * $(G4PY_EXLIB_LIBDIR) specified in a module makefile.


You can import Geant4Py modules in Python just like

>>> import Geant4

or

>>> from Geant4 import *


Notes:
-----
1) >> IMPORTANT <<
All users' libraries should be build in shared libaries.

2) Development Environment:
OS:             SuSE Linux 10.3 (x86-64)
g++ :           4.2.1
Python:         2.5.1
CLHEP:          1.9.3.2 / 2.0.3.2
BOOST-Python:   1.33.1
ROOT:           5.18/00

Have A Fun!!

                                 H. Yoshida and K. Murakami
				 16 November 2006 for Geant4-8.2 release
==========================================================================

Geant4Py package can be installed in  Linux or Mac OS X systems. Documentation
on   the    installation   and   the   latest   version    is   available   at
www-geant4.kek.jp/projects/Geant4Py.

This text  is a supplementary document  dedicated to Mac OS  X.  The following
installation procedure was tested on a MacBook; Mac OS X 10.4.8 (8L2127), and 
Darwin-8.8.1.
       

0) General remarks

 You have to install ALL packages from the system DVD, including supplementary
 packages and Xcode packages. Then, OpenGL must work.

 a. Compilation of Geant4 libraries; 
      *.dylib must be created and all header files must be assembled. So
         %make global; make includes
 b. Linker; 
      If ld (linker) complains "Undefined symbols", try
         %setenv MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET 10.4
 c. Path of the Dynamic Libraries ;
      If you have used Configure script to make the Geant4 libraries, the paths
      to the dylibs are set automatically. The environment variables can be
      checked in $G4INSTALL/.config/bin/Darwin-g++/env.csh.
 d. X window;
      For visialization with OpenGL, you have to start Xserver and
         %setenv DISPLAY localhost:0.0                                                                               
1) Installation of Python 2.4.3

The  latest  Mac  products  (as   of  October  2006)  include  Python  2.3  by
default. This  is not  bad for  the basic installation  of Geant4Py,  but some
examples  here   require  Python  2.4  which  provides   advanced  OS  related
functionalities.  So, we recommend you to install Python 2.4.3. (Python 2.5 is
already  published  but  we  don't  tested it  with  respect  to  boost_python
wrappers.)

Visit  the Python language  Web site;  http://www.python.org/download/mac/ and
follow   the  instructions.    Universal-MacPython-2.4.3-*.dmg   is  available
there. Or the site http://pythonmac.org/packages/ provides also *.dmg package,
too.

2) Installation of Boost-Python 

 Visit  the  site  http://boost.org/  and download  boost-1_33_1,  the  latest
version. Then,  run the configure script and  then make libboost_python.dylib.
Please make install it to  the default prefix directory, i.e., /usr/local, for
simplcity.

3) Compilation of Geant4Py

If you have installed Python-2.4  and Boost-1_33_1 as above, you can configure
Geant4Py as below;

./configure macosx --with-python-incdir=/usr/local/include/python2.4\
                   --with-python-libdir=/usr/local/lib/python2.4\
                   --with-boost-incdir=/usr/local/include/boost-1_33_1\
                   --with-boost-libdir=/usr/local/lib\
                   --with-boost-python-lib=boost_python-1_33_1

And  then,   %make;  make  install.   The  libraries  will  be   installed  in
$G4INSTALL/environments/g4py/lib whose path must be added to PYTHONPATH.

If you want to enjoy examples/education, wxPython package is necessary.

4) Installation of wxPython

Download  the latest  version  of wxPython  from http://www.wxpython.org/  and
create the library. The next instructions are taken from the above Web page.

%cd $WXDIR
%mkdir bld
%cd bld
%../configure --prefix=/opt/wx/2.7 \
             --with-mac\
             --with-opengl \
             --enable-debug \
             --enable-geometry \
             --enable-graphics_ctx \
             --enable-sound --with-sdl \
             --enable-mediactrl \
             --enable-display \
             --disable-debugreport 

And then make; make install.
You have to setenv/export PYTHONPATH, adding /opt/wx/2.7

5) Run

 g4py/examples/education/lesson1/Lesson1Wx.py and lesson2/Lesson2Wx.py are
 exaples, using wxPython GUI toolkits. Run them,
    %python Lesson1Wx.py
