# - Geant4 CMake Versioning File for External Projects
# This file is configured by Geant4 for use with CMake's find_package in
# Config mode. It enables external projects to determine the version of 
# Geant4 found. More importantly, it allows that command to automatically 
# determine whether the found install is compatible with any VERSION that 
# was supplied with find_package.
#
# This file is configured by Geant4's CMake system and SHOULD NOT BE EDITED

# Check whether the requested PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION is compatible with this
# installed version.
