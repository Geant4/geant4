                 Geant4 10.6 - patch-03 Release Notes
                 ------------------------------------

                                                          6 November 2020

List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 10.6.p02:

  o Analysis:
    --------
    + Fixed definition of UI commands in G4AnalysisMessenger (for 2D and
      3D histograms).
    + Updated to g4tools 5.0.6:
      o Changed usage of Google style fonts.
      o Fixed compilation warnings on clang-10.

  o Event:
    -----
    + Fixed misleading error message in G4SPSPosDistribution.
      Addressing problem report #2275.

  o Global:
    ------
    + Re-instate static pointer for 'masterG4coutDestination' in
      G4coutDestination with proper symbol exporting on Windows
      (necessary for MT builds). Restores trapping of G4cout from
      workers in Qt GUI.
    + Updated date and version for 10.6.p03.

  o Intercoms:
    ---------
    + Added StoL() method in G4UImessenger for parsing string to long int.
      Addressing problem report #2276.

  o Interfaces:
    ----------
    + Added fix in G4Qt to properly set GL on Windows (see Forum topic #3144).

  o Persistency - gdml:
    ------------------
    + Fixed treatment of loops. Addressing problem report #2273.

  o Processes - Hadronic:
    --------------------
    + cross_sections:
      o G4CrossSectionElastic, G4CrossSectionInelastic: fix for ions and
        anti-ions, where the max energy of applicability of the (elastic and
        inelastic) cross-sections must scale with the absolute baryonic number;
        however, the cross-sections objects are often shared between the
        different types of ions (d, t, He3, alpha, and genericIon), therefore
        we scale by a large value (256, safely larger than the number of
        nucleons of the heaviest nuclides).
    + models/de_excitation:
      o G4NuclearLevelData: more safe initialisation of data in MT mode, use
        mutex locks only within each method, whithout calls to other methods.
      o G4ExcitationHandler: call to G4NuclearLevelData to initialise data for
        levels for all elements possibly involved in the geometry.
      o G4FermiFragmentsPoolVI: use old interface to nuclear levels.
    + models/particle_hp:
      o G4ParticleHPInelastic, G4ParticleHPInelasticData: improved error
        message in the case that both G4PARTICLEHPDATA and the related
        particle-specific environmental variable (e.g. G4PROTONHPDATA) are
        not defined. The recommendation is to define only G4PARTICLEHPDATA.
    + models/parton_string/diffraction:
      o G4FTFModel: quasi-elastic is not applied any longer when the target
        nucleus has one nucleon and the projectile hadron is not an ion. This
        avoids to double count elastic scattering (as reported by NA61/SHINE
        in 158 GeV/c proton interactions on liquid hydrogen).
        Addressing problem report #2274.
    + models/parton_string/hadronization:
      o G4VLongitudinalStringDecay: fix in ProduceOneHadron() method, to remove
        an inconsistency in the treatment of low-mass strings with respect to
        the method G4QGSMFragmentation::FragmentString(). As consequence of
        this inconsistency, interactions with fewer intra-nuclear collisions
        were favored, therefore producing fewer secondary hadrons.
      o G4QGSMFragmentation : proper exit in the method FragmentString()
        when the string mass is below the threshold.
    + models/parton_string/qgsm:
      o G4BaryonSplitter: removed inexisting in Geant4 excited hyperon states
        (Sigma* and Xi*).

  o Run:
    ---
    + Fix for rndmSaveThisEvent() not properly working in multi-threaded mode.
      Addressing problem report #2278.
    + Allow setting of seeds with 'long' values for '/random/setSeeds'
      UI command. Addresses problem report #2276.

  o Visualization:
    -------------
    + Fixed compilation warnings on clang-10 in gMocren and gl2ps.

  o Examples:
    --------
    + advanced/brachytherapy
      o Added missing call to "/run/initialize" in VisualisationMacro.mac.
    + advanced/purging_magnet
    + advanced/STCyclotron
      o Fixed README.
