                 Geant4 10.6 - patch-02 Release Notes
                 ------------------------------------

                                                             29 May 2020

List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 10.6.p01:

  o Configuration:
    -------------
    + CMake:
      o Added activation of build of G4Py through GEANT4_USE_PYTHON flag.
        Requires Boost.Python (only 1.72 tested so far) using Python 3 or
        newer (only 3.7 tested).
        Verify that MT builds use 'global-dynamic' TLS mode to allow Python
        module loading of dynamic libraries.
      o Fix to avoid configuration of applications failure due to variables
        having empty values, and consequently no "type" argument. Only store
        values in the package cache if they are set and have a valid value.
      o Use full path to datasets if GEANT4_INSTALL_DATADIR is an absolute path.
        Customize CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR in a single location.
      o Suppress warnings about icc libraries not existing for Intel icc-19.

  o Environments:
    ------------
    + G4Py: integrated build, test, and install of geant4py with core Geant4
      CMake build system.

  o Geometry:
    --------
    + solids/specific:
      o Fixed mismatch in signature of constructors for the G4UExtrudedSolid
        wrapper.

  o Global:
    ------
    + G4UnitsTable: added inheriting constructors for std::vector.
      Addressing problem report #2232.
    + Updated date and version for 10.6.p02.

  o Intercoms:
    ---------
    + Accept null string as an alias value. Addessing problem report #2208.

  o Physics Lists
    -------------
    + constructors/limiters
      o G4GenericBiasingPhysics: added missing code for parallel geometries
        for all neutral and charged particles.

  o Processes - Electromagnetic:
    ---------------------------
    + utils:
      o G4LossTableBuilder: fixed typo. Addressing problem report #2230.

  o Processes - Hadronic:
    --------------------
    + models/de_excitation:
      o G4DeexPrecoParameters: set default time limit to 1 microsecond
        for isomer production (now, in all cases, isomers with half-life time
        above 1 microsecond are produced, whereas before this happened
        only when Radioactive Decay was activated, else only above 1000 sec).
        Addressing problem report #2226.
    + models/lend:
      o New class G4LENDGammaModel to sample GND gamma-nuclear reactions.
        New class G4LENDGammaCrossSection to sample GND gamma-nuclear reactions.
        Added documentation to MCGIDI_outputChannel.
        Rewritten G4LENDInelastic to take care of large baryon number
        violations. Addressing problem report #2174.
    + models/particle_hp:
      o In G4ParticleHPInelasticBaseFS, use QI[0]-QI[it] for excitation and
        added particle definition protection to 'iLevel' calculation.
        Addressing problem report #1838.
      o Correction in G4ParticleHPInelasticBaseFS and
        G4ParticleHPInelasticCompFS. Removed deletion of 'theReactionXsec'
        in G4ParticleHPPhotonDist() destructor as memory allocation does
        not take place in this class. Addressing problem report #1824.
      o In G4ParticleHPThermalScattering::create_E_isoAng_from_energy(),
        added fatal exception for case when pointers panEPM_T_EL or panEPM_T_EH
        are null; fixing Coverity reports.
      o Corrected copy constructor in G4ParticleHPDataPoint.
    + models/parton_string/hadronization:
      o G4QGSMFragmentation, G4LundStringFragmentation: fixed Coverity defects
        warnings; if fragmentation at low energy is not possible, always return
        flag "false"; use nullptr.
    + models/radioactive_decay:
      o G4RadioactiveDecayBase, G4RadioactiveDecay, G4Radioactivation:
        use G4VERBOSE consistently; in G4Radioactivation, fixed forgotten
        change of verbosity from 0 to 1.

  o Examples:
    --------
    + advanced/ChargeExchangeMC
      o Fixed compilation error on main().
      o Fixed CMake build script for dependence on Qt libraries.
    + basic/B2
      o Updated READMEs and added a comment in B2PrimaryGeneratorAction
        that starting a primary particle on the world boundary requires
        shooting in a direction towards inside the world.
    + extended/biasing/ReverseMC01
      o RMC01AnalysisManager: use double for computation of mean and RMS;
        added protection for sqrt() argument, to avoid a problem due to
        precision loss in arithmetic computations.
    + extended/exoticphysics/monopole
      o G4MonopolePhysics: minor code clean-up for thread safety
      o Do not instantiate VisManager in the batch mode in main();
        fixed some typos.
      o G4MonopoleTransportation: removed check if monopole is opticalphoton
        or not as no longer necessary.
