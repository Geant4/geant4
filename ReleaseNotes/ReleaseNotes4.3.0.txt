        libraries (static still default): G4LIB_BUILD_SHARED and
        G4LIB_BUILD_STATIC.
      o Introduced new variable (G4LIB_USE_GRANULAR) to force using of
        granular libraries.

1. Supported and Tested Platforms
---------------------------------

  o SUN Solaris 5.6/5.7, C++ 4.2 Patch 104631-04, C++ 5.1 Patch 109490-01.
  o HP 10.20, aCC C++ B3910B A.01.23
  o Linux 2.2.12-20, gcc C++ egcs-2.91.66 (egcs 1.1.2).
      This configuration was tested with the RedHat 6.1 distribution, but
      versions of Geant4 have also been compiled successfully on Debian
      and Suse distributions.
  o NT 4.0 with Service Pack 4 and Cygnus Tools b20 with:
      Visual C++ 6.0 Service Pack 2

Platforms also tested but giving rise to some problems - see below:

  o DEC V4.0, cxx C++ V6.1-027.

Platforms configured but not tested and not supported:
  o SGI V6.5.5, CC 7.2.1 with ObjectSpace
  o AIX 4.3.2, xlC compiler with ObjectSpace


2. ANAPHE and CLHEP
-------------------

Geant4 3.0 requires the installation of CLHEP. 

See <A href="http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/lhc++/INSTALLATION/clhep.html">
CLHEP</A>. Tests have been performed with CLHEP 1.6.0.0.

By default, the CLHEP installation scripts will activate ISO/ANSI C++ features
if the compiler is capable. You need to explicitly disable CLHEP settings in
case you wish non-ISO/ANSI setup on specific compilers (for example, DEC).

Geant4 3.0 coworks with ANAPHE 3.2.0 and components included therein:
  Objectivity 5.2.1 
  ObjectSpace 2.1
  HepODBMS 0.3.1.4
  CLHEP 1.6.0.0

For more information about ANAPHE 3.2.0, see:
  <A href="http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/lhc++/release/3.2.0/3.2.0.html">ANAPHE 3.2.0</A>


3. The Standard Template Library
--------------------------------

The following versions of STL have been tested:

   ObjectSpace STL on
          DEC, HP and SUN (CC 4.2).

          See <A href="http://www.objectspace.com/">ObjectSpace</A>.

   "Native" STL on: Windows/NT, Linux, HP, DEC and SUN (CC 5.1).

This is selected at installation/compile time by the environment variable
G4USE_OSPACE in the case of the former - see documentation.

NOTES:
- Be aware that by default, the installation scripts will expect to use
  the native STL implementation. You must set the G4USE_OSPACE variable
  in the environment in order to select the ObjectSpace implementation.

- Platform specific setup:
  o DEC:   ObjectSpace is required in non ISO/ANSI setup.
           Native STL is required for ISO/ANSI setup.
  o HP:    either ObjectSpace or native STL can be used (non ISO/ANSI setup).
  o SUN:   ObjectSpace is required in non ISO/ANSI setup (CC 4.2).
           Native STL is required for ISO/ANSI setup (CC 5.1 only).
  o Linux: Native STL is required (non ISO/ANSI setup).
  o NT:    Native STL and ISO/ANSI setup required.

In the interest of stability, part of the code in Geant4 3.0 still makes use
of the "STL Interface" wrapper classes, used for allowing the migration from
Rogue Wave Tools.h++ container library.  For these the emphasis has remained
on correct behaviour, rather than performance.


4. Persistency
--------------

 Platform
 --------

 Persistency in Geant4 3.0 release is tested on the following
 platforms:

 G4SYSTEM       OS        C++ compiler   HepODBMS    Objectivity
 ---------  -----------   ------------   ---------   -----------
 SUN-CC     SunOS 5.6     CC 4.2         0.3.1.4     5.2.1
 SUN-CC5    SunOS 5.7     CC 6.0         0.3.2.3 (*) 6.0 (*)
 Linux-g++  RedHat 6.1    egcs-2.91.66   0.3.1.4     5.2.1

 (*) HepODBMS header files must be prepared with "ooddlx -noline" option.
     See below.

 Known Problems
 --------------

 - There are several warning messages on some platforms during the
   installation of the libraries and the compilation of the examples.
   Most of them can be safely ignored.  It is annoying but hard to get
   rid of them due to various reasons.

 - A warning message "Could not find naming root directory" appears at
   runtime of the persistency examples. It is generaged by HepDbApplication
   in HepODBMS. It can be ignored.

 - On Solaris7 (SUN-CC5), persistent header files has to be generated by
   ooddlx with "-noline" option to work around a bug in C++ compiler.
   This workaround applies not only to Geant4 Persistency category but
   also to HepODBMS, and the user defined ddl files as well.  This option
   removes the "#line" directive of the file name and the line number of
   the original ddl file.  As a consequences, C++ compiler no longer
   "tell" the correct file name and the line number of the ddl file if
   compiler error occurs.  Try to identify the compiler error by first
   looking into the header file generated by ooddlx, and then locate the
   source of the problem by looking into the ddl file.
   A patch to the compiler is expected from Sun.
   

5. Compiler Specific Problems
-----------------------------

  o DEC V4.0, cxx C++ V6.1-027.

    - We have found cases of mis-compilation of min and max templates
      on DEC.  We have traced those which cause serious malfunction
      but there is no guarantee that there are no other cases.
      Detailed inspection of assembler output suggests that this
      problem might not be confined to min and max.  This has been
      reported to DEC/Compaq.  We understand a new version 6.2 of the
      compiler is now available.  However we cannot guarantee correct
      execution of Geant4 on DEC with the current version of the
      compiler.
    - A bug in cin.getline() system function causes an anomalous
      behavior when running in interactive-mode on DEC-cxx 6.1 in
      ISO/ANSI mode. We tested the bug has been fixed in more recent
      versions of the compiler.


6. Known Run-Time Problems and Limitations
------------------------------------------

For a complete list of outstanding run-time problems and to submit any
problem you may find running this version of Geant4, please refer to the
Geant4 Problem Reporting System, available on the Web at this address:

    http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/cgi-bin/geant4/problemreport


7. Compilation Warnings
-----------------------

There are compilation warnings on some platforms.  We do not believe
that any will lead to incorrect run-time behaviour, but we are working
on reducing them.


8. Known Run-Time Warnings
--------------------------

The following messages can be written to error output while tracking.  We
believe none give rise to incorrect behaviour.

  o G4PropagateInField: Warning: Particle is looping 
    -  tracking in field will be stopped. 
       It has performed 10000 steps in Field  while a maximum of 10000
       are allowed.
