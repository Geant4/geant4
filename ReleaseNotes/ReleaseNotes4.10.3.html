<H2>3. Items for migration of the user code</H2>

Listed here is some relevant information on developments included in this
release.
Note that for all users a full re-installation of libraries (or a full
re-compilation) and a re-compilation of user applications is required.

<P> </P>
<B>General</B>
<P> </P>
<UL>
<LI>Minimum required version of CMake to build Geant4 is 3.3.</LI>
</UL>

<P> </P>
<B>Run</B>
<P> </P>
<UL>
<LI>A new application state <TT>G4State_Init</TT> is introduced. Geant4
    becomes this state during initialization of geometry and physics.
    Ordinary users who use G4RunManager or G4MTRunManager
    won't see any difference, and thus no migration is required.
    For users having their own custom run manager which changes the
    Geant4 application state, it is required to make sure the state
    change to <TT>G4State_Idle</TT> takes place after the initialization of
    geometry and physics. User's custom run manager does not need to
    change Geant4 application state to <TT>G4State_Init</TT> as it is
    taken care by G4RunManagerKernel.</LI>
</UL>

<P> </P>
<B>Geometry</B>
<P> </P>
<UL>
<LI>A new minor release of the GDML schema, GDML-3.1.4, is used,
    supporting export of scaled volumes.
    The new schema is fully compatible with old schema versions
    and schema validation thorugh network is already activated against it.</LI>
</UL>

<P> </P>
<B>Senditive Detectors</B>
<P> </P>
<UL>
<LI>An explicit call to G4SDManager::AddNewDetector() <U>must now be added</U>
    in order to register a sensitive-detector. The use of
    G4VUserDetectorConstruction::SetSensitiveDetector() no longer does
    this implicitly.</LI>
</UL>

<P> </P>
<B>Electromagnetic and optical physics</B>
<P> </P>
<UL>
<LI>The data file G4EMLOW-6.50 should be used.</LI>
<LI>It is recommended to use C++ interface to G4EmParameters and/or UI commands 
    from G4EmParametersMessenger for EM parameters definition. The class
    G4EmProcessOptions still exist but may provide wrong configuration of
    EM physics, this class will be removed in the next public release.</LI>
</UL>

<P> </P>
<B>Hadronic physics</B>
<P> </P>
<UL>
<LI>The new data sets <TT>G4PhotonEvaporation-4.3</TT>, 
    <TT>G4RadioactiveDecay-5.1</TT> and <TT>G4ENSDFSTATE-2.1</TT> 
    should be used. Updated also the optional data-set <TT>G4TENDL-1.3</TT></LI>
<LI>The <TT>G4PhotonEvaporation-4.3</TT> data sets include two sets of gamma level data. 
    By default the old set (equivalent to <TT>G4PhotonEvaporation-3.2</TT>) is used.
    When radioactive-decay is enabled (G4RadioactiveDecayPhysics constructor added
    to the physics-list), the new data format for gamma-level data is used.</LI>
</UL>

<P> </P>
<B>Analysis</B>
<P> </P>
<UL>
<LI>The parameter classes G4Parameter&lt;T&gt;, G4VParameter and G4ParameterManager
    are renamed to G4Accumulable&lt;T&gt;, G4VAccumulable and G4AccumulableManager
    respectively, to better reflect the meaning of the <I>accumulable</I> objects.</LI>
<LI>Stopped support of HBOOK output format.</LI>
</UL>
<P> </P>

<P> </P>
<B>Data Sets</B>
<P> </P>
This release introduces new data set versions.
Please see the corresponding details in
<A href="#data-notes">Section 9</A> of this document.
<UL>
<LI>New data set versions: <TT>G4EMLOW-6.50, G4ENSDFSTATE-2.1,
    G4RadioactiveDecay-5.1, G4PhotonEvaporation-4.3</TT>.
</LI>
<LI>In order to use <TT>ParticleHP</TT> for charged particles
    (protons, deuterons, tritons, He3 and alphas), an optional data
    set <TT>G4TENDL-1.3</TT> is required, and should be downloaded in
    addition from the Geant4 web site.</LI>

<H2>4. New Developments and Capabilities </H2>

<B>Analysis</B>
<UL>
<LI>Implemented merging of ntuples in multi-threaded mode with Root output type.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Geometry</B>
<UL>
<LI>A configuration option allows an installation to use the
    <A HREF="https://cern.ch/aidasoft/USolids">VecGeom Unified Solids Library</A>
    primitives, to replace the original Geant4 solids, as in the
    previous release. The path to an external installation of the VecGeom
    library (VecGeom version <TT>v00.03.00</TT>) should be specified.
    See the associated instructions file for configuration and installation.</LI>
<LI>New magneticfield stepper classes G4BogackiShampine23 (BS23),
    G4BogackiShampine45 (BS45) and DormandPrince745 (DP45), implementing 
    third order (BS23) and fifth order (BS45, DP45) embedded RK tableaus;
    together with new FSAL integrator driver classes and steppers.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Electromagnetic physics</B>
<UL>
<LI>Upper energy limit of physics tables is extended from <TT>10 TeV</TT> to
    <TT>100 TeV</TT>.</LI>
<LI>A set of new UI commands is added which allows defining models per region.
    In particular, UI commands defining PAI model, DNA models, MicroElec models
    for a given geometrical region (G4Region) on top of any EM physics
    configuration. It is also possible to define alternative reference physics
    configurations for a particular region on top of any other reference EM
    physics.</LI>
<LI>A new process of <TT>e+e-</TT> pair creation by electron or positron is added 
    to <TT>Option3</TT> and <TT>Option4</TT> EM physics configurations.</LI>
<LI>Sampling of lateral displacement for the Urban model has been updated in
    <TT>Option3</TT>, <TT>Option4</TT>, <TT>Livermore</TT> and <TT>Penelope</TT>
    physics configurations. Due to that, the Urban model predictions become close
    to predictions of Goudsmit-Saunderson and Wentzel-VI models.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Hadronic physics</B>
<UL>
<LI>Achieved consistent set of data - G4ENSDFSTATE-2.1, G4RadioactiveDecay-5.1, 
    G4PhotonEvaporation-4.3, in terms of isomer excitation levels - and physics
    models which use these data - radioactive-decay and photon-evaporation,
    in terms of energy and lifetime of excited nuclides.</LI>
<LI>Precompound/de-excitation code has been restructed in order to use the
    same data as radioactive-decay model and former, internal hard-coded data
    are not used any longer. 
    The possibility to simulate correlated emissions of gammas has been
    introduced but not yet activated.</LI>
<LI>Improved the evaporation spectrum of Bertini-like intra-nuclear cascade 
    model (BERT). 
    This reduces the overproduction of low-energy neutrons and protons.</LI>
<LI>Extended the INCLXX intra-nuclear cascade model to include eta and omega
    meson production.</LI>
<LI>Fritiof (FTF) string model is similar to the one in version 10.2.p02,
    except for the treatment of the excited nuclear remnant, in order to
    produce hadronic showers similar to those in version 10.1.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Particles</B>
<UL>
<LI>Particles properties have been updated according to PDG-2015.</LI>
<LI>New floating level base to ions and related classes is introduced in this release,
    and the nuclide table has been adapted to conform to the new scheme.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Physics Lists</B>
<UL>
<LI>A new set of UI commands is available allowing to enable a specific
    EM physics configuration per G4Region by a name of EM physics constructor.</LI>
<LI>The physics lists <TT>FTFP_BERT</TT> and <TT>FTFP_BERT_HP</TT> have changed
    the transition region between Bertini-like (BERT) and Fritiof/Precompound-de-excitation
    (FTFP) models: now it is between <TT>3</TT> and <TT>12 GeV</TT> (instead of
    <TT>4</TT> and <TT>5 GeV</TT>), for pions, kaons, proton and neutron (for hyperons
    it remains unchanged between <TT>2</TT> and <TT>6 GeV</TT>; for anti-baryons,
    FTF is used everywhere).</LI>
</UL>

<B>Visualization and Interfaces</B>
<UL>
<LI>Significant improvements in the Qt interface and graphics.</LI>
<LI>A significant speed-up for OpenGL viewers (including Qt) on some platforms
    due to better use of the graphics pipeline. The associated command that
    controls this behaviour is
    <TT>/vs/ogl/flushAt [endOfEvent endOfRun eachPrimitive NthPrimitive NthEvent never]</TT>.
    The default is <TT>/vis/ogl/flushAt NthEvent 100</TT>.</LI>
<LI>A new feature is the ability to <I>fly-through</I> saved views with
    <TT>/vis/viewer/interpolate</TT> (not yet available on Windows).
     Use the help command to see options (one may make movie sequences this
     way).</LI>
<LI>A default icon toolbar for the Qt driver. The file <TT>icons.mac</TT> in
    some examples is no longer needed. <I>Viewer properties</I> (editable)
    and <I>pick informations</I> have been moved to this new icon toolbar.</LI>
<LI>A new command, <TT>/gui/defaultIcons [enable disable]</TT>, to manage the
    default icon toolbar.</LI>
<LI>Improved command line completion in the Qt interface.</LI>

<H2>5. Expected effects on physics and computing performance</H2>

<B>Electromagnetic physics</B>
<UL>
<LI>Expected similar CPU/memory performance and physics results for the
    default EM physics configuration.</LI>
<LI>High energy EM showers will be narrower on per-mille level due to fixed
    LPM effect treatment for the bremsstrahlung.</LI>
<LI>Sampling scattering by the Urban model should be improved for <TT>Option3</TT>,
    <TT>Option4</TT>, <TT>Livermore</TT> and <TT>Penelope</TT> physics configurations.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Hadronic physics</B>
<UL>
<LI>Based on tests performed on simplified calorimeters, hadronic showers are
    similar to those in version 10.1.
    Some differences - in particular wider hadronic showers and smoother
    behaviour as a function of the projectile energy, especially between
    <TT>4</TT> and <TT>12 GeV</TT> - are due to the change of transition region
    between  FTFP and BERT in the physics lists <TT>FTFP_BERT</TT> and
    <TT>FTFP_BERT_HP</TT> (now set to <TT>3-12 GeV</TT>).</LI>
<LI>The energy response of hadronic showers in Iron and Copper is similar
    to the one in version 10.1, i.e. a few percent lower than in version 10.2;
    for  heavier absorbers (Tungsten and Lead), it is a few percent lower than
    both versions 10.1 and 10.2.</LI>

        the treatment of the excited nuclear remnant, in order to produce
        hadronic showers similar to those in G4 10.1.</LI>
        For QGS, this means that the model is very similar to the one in

    <LI>In G4VPartonStringModel, instead of having the string creation loop

        creation and fragmentation, with max 1000 attempts, and in the case
        of failure a just-warning exception is thrown.

        the impact of multiple scattering on hadronic showers.</LI>
    <LI>Moved code to be inline in G4RegisterPhysLists so that it gets
        compiled as part of the G4PhysListRegistry compilation unit.
        This ensures that all the physics lists declared to the registry are
        referenced by it such that the linker will include them if libraries
        are built statically.</LI>
    <LI>Added G4_REFERENCE_PHYSLIST_FACTORY[_NS] for pulling in lists
        from static libraries. Fixed issue where G4PhysListRegistry didn't

<LI><B>Modeling:</B>
    <UL>
    <LI>Introduced drawing and filtering by encountered volume.
        i.e., <TT>/vis/modeling/trajectories/create/drawByEncounteredVolume</TT>,
              <TT>/vis/filtering/trajectories/create/encounteredVolumeFilter</TT>
        and their associated commands.
        This selects only by a single string, the physical volume name.
        If there are more than one physical volumes with that name then any
        trajectory encountering any one of those volumes will be selected.
        If the user sets more than one physical volume name (by using the set
        command more than once) the trajectory will be selected if it encounters
        either of those volumes and which of the attributes (e.g., colour)
        associated with those volumes is chosen is arbitrary.
        A more comprehensive facility would allow the user to select by
        encountered touchable, i.e., by the full path and copy numbers of the
        physical volume - but that is a job for the future if a use case arises.</LI>
    <LI>Added specific arguments to LocateGlobalPointAndSetup() to handle
