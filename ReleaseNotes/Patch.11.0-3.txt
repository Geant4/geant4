                 Geant4 11.0 - patch-03 Release Notes
                 ------------------------------------

                                                           16 September 2022

List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 11.0.2:

  o Configuration
    -------------
    + CMake:
      o Update extraction of include paths from VecGeom to use imported target
        property. Addressing problem report #2485.

  o Geometry:
    --------
    + management:
      o Added protection in G4GeometryManager for Open/CloseGeometry() to
        be executed only by master thread. Addressing problem report #2502.

  o Global:
    ------
    + Commented out debug printout in G4ThreadLocalSingleton method.
    + Updated date and version for 11.0.3.

  o Parameterisations:
    -----------------
    + gflash:
      o GFlashHitMaker: fix to make it compatible with command-based scorer.

  o Particles:
    ---------
    + Fixes for transportation of hypernuclei and anti-hypernuclei: in G4Ion,
      set (forgotten) 'isGeneralIon' to false for hypernuclei and
      anti-hypernuclei, to avoid they get assigned same processes as
      'GenericIon'.
      In G4DoubleHyperDoubleNeutron and G4AntiDoubleHyperDoubleNeutron, added
      (forgotten) call to SetDecayTable(), to have the decay table defined for
      these particles.
      In G4ParticleDefinition, protect methods GetNumberOfLambdasInHypernucleus()
      and GetNumberOfAntiLambdasInAntiHypernucleus() against baryonic resonances
      with high spins (such as N(2220), N(2250) and their anti-particles) which
      have 8-digits PDG codes, but which are not hypernuclei or anti-hypernuclei.

  o Physics Lists:
    -------------
    + constructors/electromagnetic
      o G4GammaGeneralProcess: fixed problem of Compton scattering selection
        in the low energy interval < 150 keV.

  o Processes - Electromagnetic:
    ---------------------------
    + utils
      o G4EmExtraParametersMessenger: fixed typo.
        Addressing problem report #2492.

  o Processes - Generic:
    -------------------
    + cuts
      o G4VRangeToEnergyConverter: fixed static methods to provide correct
        initialisation of energy limits.

  o Processes - Hadronic:
    --------------------
    + models/particle_hp
      o G4ParticleHPInelastic, G4ParticleHPCapture, G4ParticleHPFission,
        G4ParticleHPElastic, G4ParticleHPThermalScattering: replaced the
        threshold used for checking the absolute energy non-conservation from
        DLB_MAX (implying no checking at all) to 350 GeV (this value allows for
        cases where the residual nucleus is not produced, even when super-heavy
        nuclides are involved).
      o G4ParticleHPContAngularPar: added protections against evaluations of
        arrays at negative index (-1), fixing rare reproducibility problems.
    + models/parton_string
      o Fixes to get isotropic distributions in annihilations at rest: in
        G4DiffractiveSplitableHadron, set proper parton index.
        In G4DiffractiveExcitation, in the CreateStrings() method, take into
        account that strings are created in G4FTFAnnihilation; by default, the
        method CreateStrings() creates a string from a wounded nucleon/hadron,
        but this is not needed in the case of annihilation.
        In G4FTFAnnihilation, removed splitting of hadron; fixed bugs in the 
        calculations of kinematical properties; set quark momenta at string
        ends, to properly account for string order on rapidity.
      o G4VSplitableHadron: changed the method Splitting() from "protected" to
        "public" (needed to change the status of SplitableHadron in
        G4FTFAnnihilation, to get isotropic distributions in annihilations
        at rest).

  o Track:
    -----
    + G4Step: added ResetPre/PostStepPoint() methods to replace a StepPoint
      without deleting the previous object.
