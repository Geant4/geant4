                 Geant4 10.7 - patch-04 Release Notes
                 ------------------------------------

                                                            9 September 2022

List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 10.7.p03:

  o Configuration
    -------------
    + CMake:
      o Update extraction of include paths from VecGeom to use imported target 
        property. Addressing problem report #2485.

  o Global:
    ------
    + Updated date and version for 10.7.p04.

  o Physics Lists:
    -------------
    + constructors/electromagnetic
      o G4GammaGeneralProcess: fixed problem of Compton scattering selection
        in the low energy interval < 150 keV.

  o Processes - Electromagnetic:
    ---------------------------
    + utils
      o G4EmExtraParameters: safe definition of StepFuction for G4GenericIon.
        Addressing problem report #2495.
      o G4EmExtraParametersMessenger: fixed typo.
        Addressing problem report #2492.

  o Processes - Hadronic:
    --------------------
    + cross_sections
      o G4ComponentAntiNuclNuclearXS: correct treatment of the cross-sections
        of light anti-nuclei on hydrogen target. This relies on the isospin
        symmetry assumption, according to which the properties of the reactions
        between anti-proton and light nuclei are equivalent to those between
        light anti-nuclei and hydrogen.
    + models/coherent_elastic
      o G4AntiNuclElastic: correction in SampleInvariantT() method of the
        highest momentum transfer (which was causing the cosine of the polar
        angle in the center-of-mass system to be larger than 1 in some cases).
        Addressing problem report #2204.
    + models/inclxx
      o G4INCLXXInterface: fixed treatment of kaon0, anti_kaon0, kaon0L, and
        kaon0S. In current reference physics lists, INCLXX is never used for
        handling kaons, although it is capable of doing so, but at process-
        level or in custom physics lists one could observe crashes when trying
        to use INCLXX for neutral kaon projectiles. The change fixes this
        misbehavior.
    + models/particle_hp
      o Fixed issue for photons too high in energy generated from
        G4NDL/Capture/FSMF6 data. Addressing problem report #2468.
      o G4ParticleHPContAngularPar: added protections against evaluations of
        arrays at negative index (-1), fixing rare reproducibility problems
        and rare crashes observed.
      o Code cleanup in G4ParticleHPContEnergyAngular and
        G4ParticleHPContAngularPar: removed debug and commented out code,
        indentation of loops and if branches.
