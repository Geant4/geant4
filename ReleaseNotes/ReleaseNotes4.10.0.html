<H2>3. Items for migration of the user code</H2>

Listed here is some relevant information on developments included in this
release, some of which may require migrations in order to upgrade from
release 9.x series to this release.
Note that for all users a full re-installation of libraries (or a full
re-compilation) and a re-compilation of user applications is required.


<P> </P>
<B>General</B>
<P> </P>
<UL>
<LI>Multi-threading:
    <UL>
    <LI>This release includes support for multi-threaded Geant4 applications.
        Parallelism is achieved at the event level, with events dispatched to
        different threads. To use multi-threading it is necessary to build
        and install Geant4 with the option of multi-threading ability activated.</LI>
    <LI>The default build of Geant4 is sequential. </LI>
    <LI>Existing (or new sequential)
        applications can be built and run without code changes, on either a
        sequential and a multi-threading capable installation of Geant4 - provided, of course,
        that mandatory changes are made to address other migration issues.</LI>
    <LI>To enable event level-paralellism first configure a build of Geant4 using the cmake switch
        GEANT4_BUILD_MULTITHREADED=ON (default is OFF); then build the Geant4 libraries and
        instantiate a G4MTRunManager (or a user-derived class) in place of G4RunManager
        in the relevant function of the program (e.g. the main function).</LI>
    </UL>
</LI>
<li>Migrating applications to Multi-threading:</li>
    <UL>
    <LI>The steps required to migrate an existing application to multi-threading is
        summerized in the 
        <A HREF="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Geant4/QuickMigrationGuideForGeant4V10">
        TWiki migration page</A>.</LI>
    <LI>Migrated examples for demonstrating use of multi-threading are:
        <UL>

          human_phantom, microbeam, microdosimetry, nanobeam,
          radioprotection.</LI>
        </UL>
    </LI>
    <LI>Even if Geant4 library is compiled with multi-thread support, legacy sequential
      application can run. </LI>
    </UL></LI>
<LI>Removed from Geant4 headers the implicit inclusions of SystemOfUnits and PhysicalConstants headers of CLHEP  .
    This may trigger compilation errors in user's code. This will require making the user
    code self-consistent, by explicitly including these missing headers files.</LI>
<LI>Introduced checks for variable/parameters shadowing. Compilation warnings
    may show up in user code in case it is also compiled using the Geant4 build setup, or using the same compiler flags.</LI>
<LI>The old GNUMake build system is no longer supported. It is strongly
    recommended to adopt CMake for the installation.</LI>
</UL>

<P> </P>
<B>Geometry</B>
<P> </P>
<UL>
<LI>Archived GeomTest* classes for overlaps checking through grid/cylinder
    lines. UI commands are replaced with calls to built-in overlaps checking
    based on random points located in surface. User's scripts relying on old
    UI commands may require migration accordingly.</LI>
<LI>The <TT>G4Polycone</TT> solid no longer supports the case in which
    either the outer or the inner surface has more than one cone or tube
    section over a finite interval of Z values. These shapes must use the
    new class <TT>G4GenericPolycone</TT> instead. The general constructor
    of <TT>G4Polycone</TT>, which uses a series of vertices, includes a
    check whether the vertices are monotonic along Z for its inner and
    outer surfaces, and issues an error if not.</LI>
<LI>Removed deprecated BREPs module and obsolete classes G4VCellScorer and
    G4VCellScorerStore.</LI>
</UL>

<P> </P>
<B>Electromagnetic and optical physics</B>
<P> </P>
<UL>
<LI>A single <TT>G4UrbanMscModel</TT> class provides the improved tuning of the Urban 
    multiple-scattering model. It replaces all previous variants of 
    the Urban model (Urban90, 93, 95 and 96), which have been removed.</LI>
<LI><TT>G4MuElec*</TT> processes and models for microdosimetry in silicon have 
    been renamed as <TT>G4MicroElec*</TT> processes and models.</LI>
<LI>Instead of <TT>G4PAIPhotonModel</TT> of ionisation, it is recommended to use
    <TT>G4PAIPhotModel</TT>.</LI>
</UL>

<P> </P>
<B>Hadronic physics</B>
<P> </P>
<UL>
<LI>The CHIPS package, the parameterized (Gheisha-like) models LEP/HEP
    and the isotope_production module have been removed.</LI>
<LI>GetIon() and FindIon() methods are removed from G4ParticleTable
    class. These methods have moved to G4IonTable class with some
    enhancements.</LI>
</UL>

<P> </P>
<B>Physics Lists</B>
<P> </P>
<UL>
<LI>Physics lists based on the CHIPS package (e.g. CHIPS, QGSC_BERT)
    or on the parameterized (Gheisha-like) models LEP/HEP (e.g. LHEP) 
    have been removed.</LI>
<LI>Physics lists that  used LEP in a restricted energy range have been 
    retained but revised: LEP has now been replaced by Fritiof and/or 
    Bertini models.    
    Typical of this case was the use of LEP modesl to bridge the gap 
    between QGS and the intra-nuclear cascade model, in particular 
    over the region of 9.5-25 GeV in QGSP_BERT which was replaced 
    by use of the FTF/Fritiof model.</LI>

<H2>4. New Developments and Capabilities </H2>

<B>General</B>
<UL>
<LI>Geant4 Version 10.0 supports (optional) event-level parallelism.
    In a multi-threaded application, at the end of first kernel initialization,
    worker threads are started and initialized. These worker threads are
    responsible for simulating events.</LI>
<LI>Event each thread is tasked is in first_come_first_served basis,
    so that event numbers each thread has are not sequential, and order of
    finished events are not sequential. </LI>
<LI>The objects that consume the largest fraction of memory
    (geometry and Electromagnetic physics tables) are shared among threads, while
    all other objects (in particular user-action and sensitive detectors) are thread-private.</LI>
<LI>If the user employs built-in command-based scorers or makes use of g4tools histogramming
    facitlities, the reduction of results is performed automatically at the end of a run.
    To accumulate user-specified quantities, the user has to implement his/her own Run
    class derived from <TT>G4Run</TT> base class to implement the reduction.</LI>
<LI>More information:
  <UL>
    <LI>Geant4 multi-threading capabilities are based on POSIX standards
        (pthreads) and on <I>Thread Local Storage</I> (TLS) extension.</LI>
    <LI>Several aspects of threading model can be customized by user.
        This includes the possibility to use an external library or package
        (e.g. TBB) to achieve paralelization. See the
        <I>examples/extended/parallel</I> directory and its content.</LI>
    <LI>A <A HREF="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Geant4/MultiThreadingTaskForce">dedicated
        Twiki page</A> contains up-to-date information of multi-threading with
        Geant4 including links to relevant documentation.</LI>
  </UL></LI>
</UL>

<B>Geometry</B>
<UL>
<LI>A new module for geometrical primitives, whose classes
    are imported from the
    <A HREF="https://aidasoft.web.cern.ch/USolids">AIDA Unified Solids Library</A>,
    is available.
    It includes alternative implementations for several shapes, aiming to
    provide CPU speed improvement  in most cases. The shapes currently included are:
    Box, Cons, GenericPolycone, Orb, Polycone, Polyhedra, Sphere, Tet, Trd,
    Tubs. </LI>
<LI>This module can be used in two modes. The first mode is available in a standard
    installation; a USolid can be used as an alternative implementation of a shape, 
    using a different name. This provides the opportunity to test the implementations 
    one by one, e.g.  <TT>G4UPolycone</TT> which has shown significant speedup.</LI>
<LI>In the second mode they can replace the default implementations of the 
    corresponding solids - this requires a special build and must be enabled 
    at configuration/build time, by adopting the dedicated compiler flag 
    <TT>G4GEOM_USE_USOLIDS</TT>.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Materials</B>
<UL>
<LI>The NIST material Manager and related classes always
    create an isotope vector for each element, using  natural abundances.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Electromagnetic physics</B>
<UL>
<LI>The model of electron-positron pair production by muons and hadrons 
    has been updated to use more detailed grid in tabulation of differential 
    cross-sections.</LI>
<LI>The PAI and PAI-photon models were cleaned up and can be used for very 
    low (down to zero) cut values.</LI>
<LI>A new angular generator model is added <TT>G4DeltaAngle</TT> which
    may be optionally used by any ionisation model. It is used by default by PAI models.</LI>
<LI>Magnetic monopole ionisation models were upgraded to be applicable 
    for non-relativistic case for any material.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Hadronic physics</B>
<UL>
<LI>The Fritiof (FTF) model has been retuned, based on an enlarged set of
    thin-target data, and the modelling of nucleon-nucleon diffraction
    has been improved. <BR>
    The Fritiof model can now handle nucleus-nucleus collisions.</LI>
<LI>The Bertini-like (BERT) model has been improved, in particular
    in the two-body angular distributions and in multibody phase space,
    and it can handle muon capture.
    </LI>
<LI>Long-lived meta-stable isotopes (isomers) are now produced
    in hadronic interactions. By default, only isomers with half-lives
    above 1 microsecond are considered. However, an enlarged set of
    isomers can be activated by setting the environmental variable
    G4ENSDFSTATEDATA to point to the new (optional) data set of
    nuclei properties from the Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File,
    G4ENSDFSTATE-1.0.</LI>
<LI>The isomers that are produced can be decayed by activating the
    RadioactiveDecay module (which is not used by default in physics
    lists, with the only exception of Shielding). </LI>
<LI>The new data libraries G4PhotonEvaporation-3.0 and G4RadioactiveDecay-4.0
    are required. </LI>
<LI>The neutron high-precision (HP) model is now capable of reading
    compressed data files, and this allowed to reduced significantly
    the size of the G4NDL library.<LI>A new verbosity control allows the
    suppression of warning messages.</LI>
<LI>A new fission fragments generator (Wendt) has been introduced.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Phonon Physics</b>
<UL>
<LI>A new minimal framework for low-temperature
    phonon physics has been introduced, with acoustic phonon particle types
    (<Code>G4PhononLong, G4PhononTransSlow, G4PhononTransFast</Code>),
    container classes for lattice dynamical constants, and processes for
    propagation and scattering of phonons, and anharmonic downconversion.</LI>
<LI>The associated example
    (<Code>examples/extended/exoticphysics/phonons</Code> has been migrated to
    use the new toolkit classes.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Generic Biasing</b>
<UL>
<LI>A new biasing capability has been introduced to allow physics-based biasing
    --process interaction occurence biasing, process final state production biasing--
    and non-physics-based biasing --e.g. splitting, killing-- to be handled through
    a set of common classes: <Code>G4VBiasingOperator, G4VBiasingOperation</Code>.</LI>
<LI>The <Code>G4VBiasingOperation</Code> class is to represent an 'atomic' biasing
    operation (occurence biasing, final state biasing, splitting, killing, etc.).</LI>
<LI>The <Code>G4VBiasingOperator</Code> class is to pilot the biasing, it selects
    the biasing operations to be applied in the current step.<BR>A biasing operator
    may also delegate the biasing operation choices to an other operator.</LI>
<LI>Biasing operations are applied by a third class <Code>G4BiasingProcessInterface</Code>
    which provides the interface between the tracking and the biasing. It collects the
    biasing operations to be applied from the current biasing operator.<BR>
    It can act as a wrapper class, controlling an underneath physics process on top
    of which it applies the biasing operations selected by the operator; it provides
    the statistical weight computation for the case of the occurence biasing.
    <BR>It can also be free of physics process, in what case it collects and applies
    non-physics-based biasing operations.</LI>
<LI>A biasing operator is attached to a <Code>G4LogicalVolume</Code> inside which,
    and only inside which, it is active. Outside, the standard tracking goes.</LI>
<LI>Two examples have been created:<BR>
    <Code>examples/extended/biasing/GB01</Code> shows how to bias process cross-sections,<BR>
    <Code>examples/extended/biasing/GB02</Code> shows how to use an MNCP-like
    'force collision' operator implemented within the present scheme (this 'force collision'
    consists of a track entering a volume which is cloned, one copy making a forced
    collision inside the volume, the other copy flying though with no interaction).</LI>
</UL>


<B>Physics Lists</B>
<UL>
<LI>In all physics lists, the neutron capture process has been
    significantly improved, both for the cross section (replacing
    Gheisha with G4NeutronCaptureXS) and the final-state modelling
    (now using G4NeutronRadCapture instead of G4LCapture).
    This affects the response and lateral width of hadronic showers
    in tungsten-based simplified calorimeters. </LI>
<LI>The more accurate inelastic cross section G4NeutronInelasticXS is used 
    for the simulation of low-energy neutrons (i.e. below 20 MeV) in  all
    physics lists which do not contain the precise neutronHP models. 
    This replaces the Barashenkov cross-sections. The NeutronXS cross-sections
    are average in bins of kinetic energy derived from neutronHP data.
    They are meant as an approximated, fast approach similar to the
    multi-group approach of other Monte Carlo radiation transport tools.</LI>
<LI>The fission process has been removed in physics lists without 
    the precise neutronHP models. For the HP-based physics
    lists, the parameterized model G4LFission is kept and used only 
    above 19.9 MeV.</LI>
<LI>Fritiof and/or Bertini models are now used in all physics lists
    to replace the parameterized (Gheisha-like) model LEP/HEP,
    which were used in several physics lists. This is neccesary  
    for the QGS-based physics lists,
    since the QGS model has not been extended to as low energies (currently
    it is used above 12 GeV) as the  FTF model (which can be used above 3 GeV).</LI>
<LI>Three new physics lists (all making use of the intranuclear cascade
    INCLXX) have been introduced: QGSP_INCLXX_HP, FTFP_INCLXX, 
    FTFP_INCLXX_HP.</LI>
<LI>All the six electromagnetic variants of the physics lists: 
    _EMV, _EMX, _EMY, _EMZ, _LIV, _PEN <BR>
    are available only by using the physics list factory 
    G4PhysListFactory. This option can be specified as part of the physics 
    list name. As before, the name string must be either an argument of a 
    particular method of the factory, or else provided in the environmental 
    variable PHYSLIST.</LI>
<LI>The following obsolete physics lists have been removed:
    CHIPS, CHIPS_HP, QGSC_BERT, QGSC_CHIPS, QGSP_BERT_CHIPS, LHEP, LHEP_EMV,
    QGSP, QGSP_QEL, QGSP_BERT_TRV, QGSP_BERT_95, QGSP_BERT_95XS,
    QGSP_FTFP_BERT_95, QGSP_FTFP_BERT_95XS.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Visualization</B> and <B>Interfaces</B>
<UL>
<LI>Visualization now supports multi-threading with basically the same feel as
    in sequential mode. Note however that if your application includes special
    visualization behaviors involving direct C++ calls to specific visualization
    draw methods, these parts of your visualization will only appear in sequential mode.</LI>
<LI>Added command to display magnentic field: /vis/scene/add/magneticField.
    For details, see the command guidance.</LI>

<!-- ============================================== -->

<H2>5. Expected effects on physics and computing performance</H2>

<B>Electromagnetic physics</B>
<UL>
<LI>About 5% speedup is expected mainly due to migration from
    std::log, std::exp to G4Log and G4Exp functions.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Hadronic physics</B>
<UL>
<LI>Simulated hadronic showers with the recommended physics list
    FTFP_BERT remain similar to those obtained with Geant4 9.6,
    except for tungsten-based calorimeters, where the energy response
    becomes lower, and lateral shape narrower, mainly due to the
    improved simulation of neutron capture.</LI>
<LI>Slight (few percent) CPU improvement for the simulation of
    hadronic showers with FTFP_BERT physics list with respect
    to Geant4 9.6.</LI>
<LI>Possible larger variations (for both observables and CPU speed)
    for the simulation of hadronic showers with other physics lists
    (e.g. QGSP_BIC) with respect to Geant4 9.6, mainly due to the
    replacement of parameterized (Gheisha-like) model LEP/HEP with
    Fritiof and/or Bertini models.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Sequential application with multi-threaded Geant4 library</B>
<UL>
<LI>If a Sequential application is linked with the Geant4 library
    that is compiled in multi-threaded mode, a small performance
    overhead (~1%) may be observed.</LI>

<UL>
  <LI>Introducing G4VVisManager::IgnoreStateChanges() virtual method.
      This method should be invoked by a class that has its own event loop,
      such as the RayTracer, material scanner, etc. If the argument is true,
      the following state changes among 'Idle', 'GeomClosed' and 'EventProc' are
      ignored. The same method with false should be invoked once such an
      event loop is over.</LI>

        Added protection in DecayIt() in loop to search for isomer levels.
        Issue fatal exception for zero pointers when daughter ions are not found.
        Added an electron mass to the parent nucleus in case of electron capture.
        This fixes the G4GeneralPhaseSpaceDecay::Pmx() mass deficit warning.
        Allow explicit decay of IT channels in DecayIt() and send residual
        nucleus to final state for tracking.
        In the case of IT, get excitation energy from parent nucleus, not daughter;

  <LI>Introducing '/control/cout/' command category for handling thread-local
      printing on cout/cerr and '/control/cout/ignoreThreadsExcept' to select
      thread for which enabling printout on cout.</LI>
  <LI>Modified G4UImanager, G4UIcommandTree and G4UIcommand classes to make such
      that all UI commands defined in the worker thread are visible by the
      G4UImanager of the master thread, so that undefined command or wrong

  <LI>Added 'IgnoreCmdNotFound' into G4UImanager required for multi-threading.
      This option is set bu default to thread-local G4UImanager objects.
      Added flags for commands to be broadcasted to thread-local UI mamaners.
      By default, all UI commands are broadcasted to worker threads at the
      moment such worker threads start local event-loop.
  <LI>A UI command directory may be specified as such that all commands in that
      directory and all descendant directories should not be broadcased to
      worker threads. This setting must be made by the argument of G4UIdirectory
      constructor and cannot be changed. Each individual command may still be
      set to be broadcasted by accessing to G4UIcommand::SetToBeBroadcasted()
      method individually.
      G4UImessenger constructor with command directory now may take a Boolean
      flag of not-to-be-broadcasted.</LI>
  <LI>Fixed problem with G4GenericMessenger where SetUnit() and SetRange()
