                 Geant4 10.3 - patch-03 Release Notes
                 ------------------------------------

                                                               20 October 2017

List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 10.3.p02:

  o Digits_hits:
    -----------
    + Fixed propagation of warning flag in G4SDStructure.
      Addressing problem report #1993.

  o Geometry:
    --------
    + magnetic-field:
      o G4NystromRK4: fixed caching of momentum, field location & value.
        Addressing problem report #1996, reported by ALICE.
        Correction in call to getField().
    + solids/specific:
      o Twisted solids: fixed bug in drawing polyhedra with negative twist
        angle. Addressing problem report #1995.
      o G4SurfaceVoxelizer: directly set components for bounding-box instead
        of recreating it in BuildBoundingBox(..).

  o Global:
    ------
    + Updated date and version for 10.3.p03.

  o Intercoms:
    ---------
    + Explicitly remove constness in G4AnyMethod by means of remove_const.
      Addressing problem report #1803. 

  o Interfaces:
    ----------
    + G4VBasicShell: fixed std::out_of_range exception in ModifyPath() when
      typing 'ls' command at the top directory.
      Addressing problem report #1989.
    + G4UIQt: set always-on-top to the picking windows.

  o Physics Lists:
    -------------
    + constructors/hadron_elastic:
      o G4HadronElasticPhysics, G4HadronHElasticPhysics: changed kaon elastic
        cross-sections from, respectively, Gheisha and Chips, to Glauber Gribov
        ones. This way, the total (elastic + inelastic) kaon cross sections are
        consistent with the PDG ones.

  o Processes - Hadronic:
    --------------------
    + cross_sections:
      o Bug fix in G4ComponentGGHadronNucleusXsc to use the correct cross-
        sections for kaons on Hydrogen; use Starkov parameterization for them.
    + models/cascade:
      o G4ElementaryParticleCollider::generateSCMmuonAbsorption: fixed case of
        rare segmentation-fault. Added clearing of particles if
        GetThreeBodyMomenta() returns no momenta.
    + processes:
      o Use class name in process description.
    + stopping:
      o Fixed Coverity defect in G4AntiNeutronAnnihilationAtRest.
        Removed static thread-local variables and simply made them local.

  o Visualization:
    -------------
    + OpenGL:
      o Fixed issue affecting repaint for external applications.
        Addressing problem report #1959.
