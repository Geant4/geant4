                 Geant4 11.3 - patch-02 Release Notes
                 ------------------------------------

                                                           25 April 2025

List of fixes included in this public patch since release 11.3.1:

  o Externals
    ---------
    + g4tools:
      o Fixed compilation errors on Windows in glarea header, triggered when enabling
        GL WIN32 support, as reported in problem report #2599.
    + zlib:
      o Fix in zutil.h to remove redundant block on macOS and allow for porting on
        macOS-15.4 with clang-17.0.0.

  o Geometry
    --------
    + management:
      o In G4GeometryManager, removed redundant declaration of not implemented method
        ChooseSequentialOptimisation().

  o Global
    ------
    + Added Scintillation, Cherenkov, Transition Radiation and Synchrotron Radiation
      processes to G4PhysicsModelCatalog::Initialize().
      Addressing problem report #2651.
    + Updated date and version for 11.3.2.

  o Parameterisations
    -----------------
    + channeling:
      o In G4VChannelingFastSimCrystalData::IonizationLosses(), fixed bug in the
        electron ionisation loss correction formula.

  o Physics Lists
    -------------
    + lists:
      o In FTFP_BERT_ATL, use the default FTF tuning parameters, as for all other
        reference physics lists. In order to enable the special FTF tune for ATLAS,
        one can either use the following C++ call in user code:
          G4FTFTunings::Instance()->SetTuneApplicabilityState( 4, 1 );
        or the UI command (before run-initialisation):
          /process/had/models/ftf/selectTuneByIndex 4

  o Processes - Decay
    -----------------
    + Removed approximation in calculation of G4Decay path length.
      Addressing problem report #2645.

  o Processes - Electromagnetic
    ---------------------------
    + utils:
      o G4VAtomDeexcitation: fix to allow PIXE simulation.
        Addressing problem report #2650.
      o Fix in G4EmTableType header to make it self-consistent.
        Reported in [GitHub PR#85](https://github.com/Geant4/geant4/pull/85).
 
  o Processes - Hadronic
    --------------------
    + models/cascade:
      o In G4CascadeFinalStateAlgorithm and G4NucleiModel, introduced the
        possibility to enable behaviour as either in Geant4 version 11.3
        (default) or as in 11.2, according to the value of Boolean flags
        through the call in G4HadronicParameters:
          SetBertiniAs11_2( true ).
        Also possible to configure the properties of nuclei of G4NucleiModel
        through the call in G4HadronicParameters:
          SetBertiniNucleiModelAs11_2( true )
        and the angular distribution of >= 4-body final-state emissions in
        G4CascadeFinalStateAlgorithm, through the call in G4HadronicParameters:
          SetBertiniAngularEmissionsAs11_2( true ).
        Note that the default changes introduced in release 11.3 are to be
        considered as a real improvement of the Bertini model, although some
        degradation of thin-target data, in particular for the pion production
        in HARP data, is observed. A retuning of the parameters of the model
        will be likely necessary in the near future, based on these changes.
    + util
      o Added accessor and modifier in G4HadronicDeveloperParameters for
        selecting the Bertini model mode as Geant4 version 11.3 (default)
        or 11.2.

  o Visualization
    -------------
    + OpenGL:
      o Fixed compilation errors on Windows in G4OpenGLWin32Viewer, triggered
        when enabling GL WIN32 support, as reported in problem report #2599.
    + RayTracer:
      o Fix in G4RayTracerXViewer for use of MT.
 
  o Examples
    --------
    + extended/geometry/vecGeomNavigation
      o Use G4cout for VecGeom logger output.
    + extended/hadronic/FlukaCern
      o Ensure compatibility with FLUKA v4-5.0: make the link time resolution
        of COMMON blocks (declared as external structs in the C++ source)
        compatible with the new FLUKA version.
