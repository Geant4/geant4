                 Geant4 11.1 - patch-01 Release Notes
                 ------------------------------------

                                                           10 February 2023

List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 11.1.0:

  o Configuration
    -------------
    + CMake:
      o Fixed configuration/use of TGS visualisation driver in geant4-config
        Addresses problem report #2525.
      o Use PROJECT_ or Geant4_ scoped _SOURCE/BINARY_DIR variables in place of
        CMAKE_  scope version to ease use of Geant4 as a CMake subproject. 
        Based on GitHub PR#52 (https://github.com/Geant4/geant4/pull/52).
      o Removed no longer required G4VecGeomShim module.
        VecGeom supports/supplies full imported targets since 1.1.18
        Use of VECGEOM_LIBRARIES variable is required to allow build against
        CUDA-enabled VecGeom.

  o Geometry:
    --------
    + magneticfield:
      o Reduced printout for setting any valid value for epsilon_min/_max in
        G4FieldManager.
    + management:
      o G4LogicalVolume: use std::shared_ptr for handling visualization attributes.
        Ignore calls to SetVisAttributes() from worker threads.
    + solids/Boolean:
      o Fixed hang-out in G4MultiUnion, caused by oveflow of 'size-1' when 'size'
        value is zero.
    + solids/specific:
      o G4QuadrangularFacet: fixed references to triangles in the warning message
        in the check for collinear vertices.

  o Global:
    ------
    + G4DataVector: simplified and corrected inline methods implementation.
    + Updated date and version for 11.1.1.

  o Materials:
    ---------
    + G4Material: allow recursive search for based material.
      Addressing problem report #2520.

  o Particles:
    ---------
    + G4AntiNeutron: set the "PDG stable" flag to "false", as for G4Neutron.
    + G4(Anti)OmegacZero: updated mean life time.

  o Physics Lists:
    -------------
    + builders
      o Updated table of processes.
    + constructors/decay
      o G4RadioactiveDecayPhysics: assigned RadioactiveDecay process to G4Triton
        (which is the only light ion that decays). Note: before, triton did not
        have beta decay, i.e. it was wrongly treated as stable even when radioactive
        decay physics was enabled; anti_triton did not, and still does not, have
        beta decay (because RadioactiveDecay, in its current implementation, does
        not handle any kind of anti-ions): in practice, this is an acceptable
        approximation because of its relatively long lifetime and the fact
        that annihilation and nuclear capture are more likely to happen before
        decay.
    + constructors/electromagnetic
      o G4GammaGeneralProcess: in all cases select the sub-process.
        Addressing problem report #2521.
    + util
      o G4HadProcesses: avoid double instantiation of capture cross-section.

  o Processes - Electromagnetic:
    ---------------------------
    + standard
      o G4UrbanMscModel: added flag for multiple-scattering positron correction.
      o Fixed compilation warning in G4GoudsmithSoundersonMscModel.
    + utils
      o G4EmParameters, G4EmParametersMessenger: added parameter, UI command
        and Get/Set methods for positron correction in multiple-scattering.

  o Processes - Hadronic:
    --------------------
    + management
      o G4HadronicProcess: moved some class members to protected.
    + models/lend
      o Fixed potential uninitialised variables.
    + models/particle_hp
      o Minor cleanup in G4ParticleHPDeExGammas header for data initialisation.
    + models/parton_string/qgsm
      o Fixed potential uninitialised variables in G4QGSMSplitableHadron.
    + processes
      o G4NeutronGeneralProcess: optimized code: initialisation methods are
        moved to source; avoid double instantiation of capture cross-section;
        reduced number of calls to cross-section, added cross-section data store
        pointer. Added setter method for setting minimum energy limit.
      o G4HadronElasticProcess: removed obsolete try/catch diagnostics not
        applicable for hadron elastic models; added forgotten integral approach
        for charged particles.

  o Processes - Transportation:
    --------------------------
    + Fixed inadvertent creation of G4TransportationParameters in
      G4Transportation constructor, determining a change of default looper
      parameters, responsible for observed warnings at run-time.
    + Fixed compilation warning about unused variable with G4VERBOSE unset.

  o Run:
    ---
    + G4PhysicsListHelper: added forgotten process of muon pair production by
      muons and added general process. Addressing problem report #2523.
    + Reduced printout in destruction of run-manager (master and workers),
      to be coherent with verbose level greater than 1.

  o Visualization:
    -------------
    + modeling
      o Fixed transform in G4TextModel; the rotation part of the transform was
        being ignored. This impacted the implementation of
        "/vis/scene/add/localAxes".
      o G4AxesModel: Tidied.

  o Examples:
    --------
    + extended/eventgenerator/exgps
    + extended/exoticphysics
    + extended/geometry/vecGeomNavigation
      o Use PROJECT_ or Geant4_ scoped _SOURCE/BINARY_DIR variables in place of
        CMAKE_  scope version to ease use of Geant4 as a CMake subproject. 
        Based on GitHub PR#52 (https://github.com/Geant4/geant4/pull/52).
    + extended/hadronic/Hadr10
      o In DetectorMessenger, define "/mydet/update" command also for PreInit
        state and call "/run/initialize" after geometry update in hadr10.in script,
        to avoid run-time warning messages in output for reinitialisation of
        geometry.
      o In SteppingAction, protecting the argument of acos to be within range.
    + extended/medical
      o Use PROJECT_ or Geant4_ scoped _SOURCE/BINARY_DIR variables in place of
        CMAKE_  scope version to ease use of Geant4 as a CMake subproject. 
        Based on GitHub PR#52 (https://github.com/Geant4/geant4/pull/52).
    + extended/medical/dna/moleculardna
      o Fixed materials definition and corrected mistake in PhysicsList.
      o Updated imput macros.
    + extended/parallel/MPI
      o Use PROJECT_ or Geant4_ scoped _SOURCE/BINARY_DIR variables in place of
        CMAKE_  scope version to ease use of Geant4 as a CMake subproject. 
        Based on GitHub PR#52 (https://github.com/Geant4/geant4/pull/52).
