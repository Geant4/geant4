    - added some protections in case of no viewer and no voxelisation.

  o G3-to-G4 tool:
    - introduced fixes to G3VolTable::GetVTE() and G3Division::CreateSolid().
    - avoid placement of top-level logical volume in G3toG4BuildTree.
    - removed obsolete files.
   
  o Examples:
    - introduced stepping verbosity (N02, N03).

      test (TestEm6)
    - introduced 'large N' input macros.
    - updated reference outputs.

Notes: 

  o  Geant4 1.1 is based on STL and the code has been upgraded to be
     ISO-ANSI C++ compliant. Code in this release include the ability to
     choose between using the 'std' namespace in ISO/ANSI mode or using
     traditional style programming in the global namespace (exceptions
     still apply concerning mathematical functions - <math.h> in global
     namespace is still in use, or standard C I/O functions).

The source code and some binary libraries are available through our "Source
Code" Web page:

1. Supported and Tested Platforms
---------------------------------

  o SUN Solaris 5.6, C++ 4.2 patch 104631-04
  o HP 10.20, aCC C++ B3910B A.01.18  or  A.01.21
  o Linux 2.2.5-22, gcc C++ egcs-2.91.66 (egcs 1.1.2).
      This configuration was tested in the RedHat 6.1 distribution, but
      versions of Geant4 have also been compiled successfully on, Debian
      and Suse distributions.

Platforms/compilers also tested but giving rise to some problems - see below:

  o DEC V4.0, cxx C++ V6.1-027.
  o SUN Solaris 5.6, C++ 5.0 patches 107357-07, 107311-09
  o NT 4.0 with Service Pack 4 and Cygnus Tools b20 with:
      Visual C++ 6.0 Service Pack 2

Platforms configured but not tested and not supported:
  o SGI V6.5.5, CC 7.2.1 with ObjectSpace
  o AIX 4.3.2, xlC compiler with ObjectSpace

2. CLHEP 1.4
------------

Geant4 1.0 requires the installation of CLHEP 1.4. 

See <A href="http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/lhc++/INSTALLATION/clhep.html">
CLHEP 1.4</A>.  

Be aware, for the platforms listed below, the standard CLHEP installation
will use ISO-ANSI setup:

  DEC: if using the compiler option "-std strict_ansi", it is required to
       compile Geant4 in ISO-ANSI mode and 'native' STL.

  NT: if CLHEP has been installed with the line:
         #define HEP-USE-STD 1
      uncommented in file config/CLHEP-x86-cygnus-win32, it is required to
      compile Geant4 in ISO-ANSI mode and 'native' STL.



3. The Standard Template Library
--------------------------------

The following versions of STL have been tested:

   "Native" STL on: Linux, HP, DEC, SUN, NT.

   ObjectSpace STL on
          DEC, HP, NT and SUN.

          See <A href="http://www.objectspace.com/">ObjectSpace</A>.

This is selected at installation/compile time by the environment variable
G4USE_OSPACE in the case of the latter - see documentation.

NOTES:
- Be aware that by default, the installation scripts will expect to use
  the native STL implementation. You must set the G4USE_OSPACE variable
  in the environment in order to select the ObjectSpace implementation.

- Platforms specific setup:
  o DEC: - Default: 'native' STL and ISO-ANSI setup.
         - G4USE_OSPACE set: selects ObjectSpace STL (required)
	                     and no ISO-ANSI setup.
  o HP:  - Default: 'native' STL and ISO-ANSI setup.
         - G4USE_OSPACE set: selects ObjectSpace STL (required)
	                     and no ISO-ANSI setup.
         - G4NO_STD_NAMESPACE set: either ObjectSpace or 'native' STL
	                     can be used.
  o SUN: - Default: 'native' STL and ISO-ANSI setup.
                             This setup requires the CC compiler version 5.0.
         - G4USE_OSPACE set: selects ObjectSpace STL (required)
	                     and no ISO-ANSI setup.
  o Linux: native STL is required. No ISO-ANSI setup.
  o NT:  - Default: 'native' STL and ISO-ANSI setup.
         - G4USE_OSPACE set: selects ObjectSpace STL (required)
	                     and no ISO-ANSI setup.

Geant4 1.1 requires the Standard Template Library.
In the interest of stability, a significant part of the code still makes use
of the "STL Interface" wrapper classes.  For these the emphasis has remained
on correct behaviour, rather than performance.


4. Persistency
--------------

- See release notes for Geant4 1.0.


5. Compiler Specific Problems
-----------------------------

  o DEC V4.0, cxx C++ V6.1-027.

      We have found cases of mis-compilation of min and max templates
      on DEC.  We have traced those which cause serious malfunction
      but there is no guarantee that there are no other cases.
      Detailed inspection of assembler output suggests that this
      problem might not be confined to min and max.  This has been
      reported to DEC/Compaq.  We understand a new version 6.2 of the
      compiler is now available.  However we cannot guarantee correct
      execution of Geant4 on DEC with the current version of the
      compiler.

  o SUN Solaris 5.6, CC 5.0 patches 107357-07, 107311-09

      The listed patches are required in order to fix a bug in the
      system Standard I/O libraries for streams.
      Part of the Geant4 code can be compiled only in debug mode (G4DEBUG
      set). A bug in the compiler optimiser causes the compiler to run in
      an infinite loop during compilation. Also, the inclusion of debug
      symbols causes the generation of abnormally huge binary objects.
      A bug report is being filed to SUN Support.

  o NT

      - Due to limitations of the VC++ optimiser, testing was done using
        the debuggable version only.
      - g3tog4 has not been ported to NT.
      - During the making of dependency files during compilation there
          are repeated warnings ("Strstrea.h not found") - this is an
          artifact of using g++ for this purpose.
      - Ignore linker warnings: "conflicts with use of other libs".
      - Ignore linker errors: "unresolved external symbol
          __imp__MessageBoxA@16". 

6. Known Run-Time Problems
--------------------------

  o Reading STEP files on DEC with optimised libraries causes a Memory
    fault - but see notes on DEC above.
  o In rare cases heavy ions appear not to be properly stopped and killed
    in tracking, therefore Geant4 sticks making many small steps. This
    behaviour has been observed on SUN and is under investigation.
  o On WindowsNT and DEC (ISO-ANSI setup), a problem can occur reading the data
    files associated with the environment variable $NeutronHPCrossSections.
    The problem is being investigated. 


7. Compilation Warnings
-----------------------

There are compilation warnings on some platforms.  We do not believe
that any will lead to incorrect run-time behaviour, however a parallel
Q/A activity is on going to reduce them.


8. Known Run-Time Warnings
--------------------------

The following messages can be written to error output while tracking.  We
believe none give rise to incorrect behaviour.

  o G4PropagatorInField::LocateIntersectionPoint: Warning: Integration
      inaccuracy requires an adjustment in the step's endpoint Two
      mid-points are further apart than their curve length difference:
      Dist = xxx curve length = yyy
  o Warning in G4Navigator::ComputeStep: The Step's starting point has
      moved...
  o G4PropagateInField: Warning: Particle is looping 
    -  tracking in field will be stopped. 
       It has performed 10000 steps in Field  while a maximum of 10000
       are allowed. 

For very high energy muons (ex. 1 TeV) warnings of this kind might be
generated:

  o G4ParticleChange::CheckIt  : the Momentum Change is not unit vector !!
    Difference:  1e-09
    G4ParticleChange::CheckIt
