                                                           21 March 2025

List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 11.3.0:

  o Analysis
    --------
    + Fix to qualify use of G4Accumulables namespace to avoid clashes and order
      dependence of inclusion of headers.
    + Removed false warnings about non-existing n-tuple and removed debug messages
      when filling inactivated n-tuple.

  o Event
    -----
    + Fixed cut&paste error in G4StackManager::TransferStackedTracks(..),
      reported by Coverity.

  o Externals
    ---------
    + CLHEP:
      o Properly export static symbols in RandFlat for DLL build support on Windows.

  o Geometry
    --------
    + magnetic_field:
      o Added missing guard in G4TMagFieldEquation header and minor cleanup.
        Fixes [GitHub PR #83](https://github.com/Geant4/geant4/pull/83).
    + management:
      o In G4GeometryManager, fix in ConfigureParallelOptimisation() to reset
        logical volumes iterator; in ReportWorkerIsDoneOptimising(), added checks
        to report fatal error if incorrect number of volumes was voxelised, and warns
        if number of workers reporting is not as expected.
        In ConfigureParallelOptimisation(), reports on the times it was called.
        Applied clang-tidy and some code cleanup; moved additional checks/warnings
        under verbosity level.
      o In G4VSolid::EstimateCubicVolume(..), initialise local variable to zero
        to silence invalid false positive warnings reported in compilation of CMSSW.
      o G4UAdapter: removed fake default constructor, clearing compilation warnings
        on gcc-14.
    + solids/CSG:
      o Hide all ENorm/ESide enums in anonymous namespaces to prevent ODR warnings.
        Identified in ATLAS Athena code built against v11.3.0.
      o Removed fake default constructor from G4U* wrappers, clearing compilation
        warnings on gcc-14.
    + solids/specific:
      o G4Polyhedra, G4UPolyhedra: fix to verify the validity of the delta phi to
        restore proper visualization.
      o Removed fake default constructor from G4U* wrappers, clearing compilation
        warnings on gcc-14.

  o Global
    ------
    + Corrected logic error in G4PhysicsTable when reading data in binary
      mode on Windows platforms.
    + In G4ThreadLocalSingleton, removed unprotected left-over debug inclusion
      of G4BackTrace header. Addressing problem report #2649.
    + Updated date and version for 11.3.1.

  o Materials
    ---------
    + Made ios flags for Store/Retrieve of G4ExtDEDXTable consistent to avoid
      issues on Windows platforms.

  o Physics Lists
    -------------
    + constructors/limiters:
      o G4GenericBiasingPhysics: fixed exception in adding call to
        AddBiasingProcessLimiter() when parallel world is not defined.
        Ignore calls to *AddPDGRange() functions if 'PDGlow' greater
        than 'PDGhigh'.

  o Processes - Cuts
    ----------------
    + In  G4ProductionCutsTable::UpdateCoupleTable(), make sure that the
      couple tables are updated if 'userEnergyCuts' vectors are set.

  o Processes - Electromagnetic
    ---------------------------
    + dna
      o Removed obsolete/commented references to G4AllocatorList.
    + lowenergy:
      o Fixed reported Coverity defects in Penenelope models, G4ShellData,
        G4FluoData and G4AugerTransition.
    + standard:
      o G4OrePowellAtRestModel: added missing decay plane rotation.

  o Processes - Hadronic
    --------------------
    + de_excitation:
      o G4ExcitationHandler, G4GammaTransition, G4PhotonEvaporation: removed
        production of unphysical states. Addressing problem report #2584.
        Changes in hadronic shower shapes for QGSP_BIC and QGSP_INCLXX physics
        lists are observed, with wider lateral shower shapes and increase in
        energy response.
    + models/radioactive_decay:
      o Fix in G4RadioactiveDecay to enable biasing in radioactive decay.
        Addressing problem report #2592.
    + util
      o G4Fragment: added protection against precision loss in computation of
        a boost vector at rest.
      o G4HadronicDeveloperParameters: added limitation of warning printout on
        change of parameters.

  o processes/scoring
    -----------------
    + Fixes to G4EnergySplitter to ensure that each call to
      SplitEnergyInVolumes() utilises the correct phantom parameterisation,
      according to [GitHub PR#80](https://github.com/Geant4/geant4/pull/80)
      Addressing problem report #2636.

  o Run
    ---
    + Correction in G4WorkerRunManager::InitializeGeometry() when invoking
      G4GeometryManager in undertaking parallel voxelisation.

    --------
    + advanced/HGCal_testbeam
      o Restore the original beam energy after it is modified.
      o Ensure non-negative beam energy.

    + extended/biasing/GB03
      o Added option -b (biasing on/off).
      o Set default splitting probability to 0.2.
      o Instantiate G4GenericBiasingPhysics only if biasing is enabled.

      o Added check for null pointer to shared data; fixing detected crash
        when biasing is off.
      o Propagate biasing on/off to parallel world construction to
        initialization of biasing classes only if biasing requested.
      o Removed unused WITH_GEANT4_UIVIS cmake option.
