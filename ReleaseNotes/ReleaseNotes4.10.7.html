<H2>2. Supported CLHEP and VecGeom version</H2>

This release of Geant4 requires and has been verified with
<A TARGET="ext" HREF="http://cern.ch/clhep/">CLHEP</A>, release <B>2.4.4.0</B>.
Use of a different CLHEP version may cause incorrect simulation results.<BR>
NOTE: an internal module of the relevant CLHEP classes is provided and can be
used as alternative to an external CLHEP library installation.<BR>
A configuration option allows a Geant4 installation to use the

<!-- ============================================== -->

<H2>4. New Developments and Capabilities </H2>

<B>General</B>
<UL>
<LI>Introducing new optional (Beta) tasking system, based on PTL
    (Parallel Tasking Library), dedicated run manager (G4TaskRunManager) and
    factory (G4RunManagerFactory), enabling use of tasks for the event loop.
    The tasking system is fully compatible with Intel TBB, which can be
    selected if GEANT4_USE_TBB=ON is specified when configuring CMake. The
    default behavior for tasking is to submit the tasks to an internal
    thread-pool and task-queue.</LI>
<LI>Introduced general facilities based on GFlash implementation to facilitate
    multiple hit (energy & position) creation from fast simulation models.</LI>
<LI>Updated SI constants, based on May 2019 redefinition of SI units.</LI>
<LI>Added G4Backtrace header for printing backtraces from raised signals.
    Can be enabled by setting GEANT4_BUILD_BUILTIN_BACKTRACE option at
    configuration.</LI>
<LI>New profiling settings for TiMemory which allow per-{run,event,track,step}
    profiling when GEANT4_USE_TIMEMORY is enabled.</LI>
<LI>Extended CMake build system to support G4Py activation through
    GEANT4_USE_PYTHON flag.</LI>
<LI>Simplified CMake builds to enable future modularisation of Geant4
    libraries.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Analysis</B>
<UL>
<LI>Major upgrade of analysis module, including support for multiple files
    and multiple output types in the same run; defeined new methods and
    corresponding UI commands. The new functions are available through a new
    G4GenericAnalysisManager class, and are demonstrated in the basic B5
    example.</LI>
<LI>Enabled handling of automatic min/max axes values in case of log scale
    in analysis tools.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Digitization, Hits &amp; Scoring</B>
<UL>
<LI>Added layered mass geometry option for the new "probe" scoring mesh.</LI>
<LI>Introducing G4VPrimitivePlotter allowing the user to extend a primitive
    scorer; added G4VScoreHistFiller and G4TScoreHistFiller, allowing scorers
    to fill histograms defined through Geant4 Analysis tools.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Geometry and Field</B>
<UL>
<LI>Improved speed for detection of volume overlaps either through
    UI commands or at geometry construction.</LI>
<LI>New templated field classes for equation and selected steppers
    to avoid virtual call for field and equation respectively.
    Non-virtual calls are expected to provide a direct speedup.
    In addition key methods are made inline to enable compilers to
    seek extra speedup by embedding them to avoid any function call.</LI>
<LI>New class G4DriverReporter to print progress of field drivers.</LI>
<LI>Enabled "check-mode" for G4PropagatorInField and G4VIntersectionLocator.</LI>
<LI>Enabled use of whiteboard for logging/debugging in G4MultiLevelLocator,
    if "check-mode" in navigation is being activated through UI command.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Materials</B>
<UL>
<LI>Added two new public methods to add elements to a material:
    AddElementsByNumberOfAtoms(...) and AddElementByMassFraction(...).</LI>
<LI>Added a new method ConstPropertyExists() to G4MaterialPropertiesTable.
    Added new methods to access/add properties with G4String and std::vector.</LI>
<LI>Added new properties for scintillation allowing 3 time constants and a
    second wavelength shifter in the same material in G4MaterialPropertiesTable
    and G4MaterialPropertiesIndex.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Electromagnetic physics</B>
<UL>
<LI>Added two extra sets of StepFunction parameters for light ions and generic
    ions. Added corresponding UI commands allowing one to customise step
    limitation for ions separately from step limits for electrons or hadrons.</LI>
<LI>Introducing thermal model of positronium decay to two gammas.
    In this model, the positronium acquires a mean kinetic energy on formation,
    which contributes to a small non-collinearity of the gammas, detectable and
    significant in PET.</LI>
<LI>Added new EM model for polarized gamma elastic scattering.</LI>
<LI>New class for handling the numerical Differential Cross-Sections(DCS) for
    Coulomb scattering of e-/e+, and added new model, implementing single
    Coulomb scattering for e-/e+.</LI>
<LI>Added new classes and models for micro-dosimetry simulation.</LI>
<LI>Added new threshold for muon/hadron bremsstrahlung and e+e- pair production
    allowing to stop a track when energy transfer exceeds the defined threshold
    and makes a new vertex.</LI>
<LI>Added a model for gamma-ray elastic interactions, able to account for
    molecular interference effects, by using database or user-custom form
    factors.</LI>
<LI>Implemented three time constants for G4Scintillation, and allow multiple
    time constants to work with scintillation by particle type.
    Added second wavelength shifting process within the same material.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Hadronic physics</B>
<UL>
<LI>For charm and bottom hadron-nuclear (elastic and inelastic)
    cross sections, the Glauber-Gribov approach has been extended to
    cover heavy hadrons.
    For final-state elastic nuclear scattering of charm and bottom
    hadron projectiles, a simple treatment is utilized.
    For final-state inelastic nuclear scattering of charm and bottom
    hadron projectiles, both Geant4 string models (FTF and QGS) have
    been extended to deal with charm and bottom quarks and diquarks
    carried by the heavy projectile hadron, as well as with the
    possibility of creating charm-anti_charm and bottom-anti_bottom
    pairs from the vacuum during the string fragmentation phase.
    Cascade models are currently not applicable for heavy hadrons and
    string models cannot handle them properly at very low energies:
    below 100 MeV a dummy model that returns as final state the
    initial state unchanged is utilized.
    The decays of secondary heavy hadrons - charm and bottom hadrons
    created by inelastic nuclear interactions of primary hadrons -
    cannot be pre-defined by Monte Carlo event generators, therefore
    a very simple approach is currently used: one single, fully hadronic
    decay is defined for each "long"-lived charm and bottom hadron,
    with a simple multi-body phase-space treatment of the decay
    kinematics. </LI>
<LI>For the evaluation of systematic errors due to uncertainties in
    the Geant4 hadronic cross sections we recommend to scale up and
    down the cross sections, independently for elastic and inelastic
    interactions, and independently for different types of hadrons.
    Currently, this is possible for the following three categories of
    hadrons: nucleons (i.e. proton and neutron together), pions (i.e.
    pion+ and pion- together), all the rest of hadrons (i.e. kaons,
    hyperons, anti-baryons, light ions, light anti-ions, charm and
    bottom hadrons all together).
    New public methods of the singleton class G4HadronicParameters
    allow to enable the scaling of these cross sections (disabled by
    default), and to set the scaling factors (by default 1.0).
    Here are some rough, practical suggestions on the scaling of the
    cross sections: +/- 10% variation for nucleons and pions;
    +/- 15-20% variation for kaons; +/- 20-30% variation for other
    hadrons. Moreover, bigger variations might be considered at low
    energies to account for the challenge of describing the shapes
    of cross sections in the threshold and resonance region. </LI>
<LI>New utility class to access hadronic processes, allowing to customise
    hadronic cross-sections per particle type.</LI>
<LI>New UI messenger for hadronic physics, currently used for controlling
    verbosity level: the UI command <TT>/process/had/verbose 0</TT> allows
    to switch off the print-out at initialization of hadronic processes,
    models and cross-sections (similar to the existing command
    <TT>/process/em/verbose 0</TT> to switch off the print-out of
    electromagnetic physics information).</LI>
<LI>New UI command to change the default upper energy limit
    (default: 100 TeV): <TT>/process/had/maxEnergy ...</TT></LI>
<LI>New G4PARTICLEXS-3.1 dataset provides accurate fusion cross-sections
    based on data, more accurate inelastic cross-sections for neutrons,
    protons, light ions, and gamma for the full energy range.</LI>
<LI>Replaced where possible the use of environmental variables in hadronic
    models with appropriate UI commands.</LI>
<LI>A new low-energy gamma-nuclear final-state model,
    <TT>G4LowEGammaNuclearModel</TT>, based on precompound de-excitation
    and providing isomer production and gamma transitions, is used in
    <TT>G4EmExtraPhysics</TT>.</LI> 
<LI>Improved treatment of antibaryon interactions in QGS.</LI>
<LI>Added handling of lepto-nuclear interactions for anti_nu_e, nu_e,
    anti_mu_nu and mu_nu.</LI>
<LI>A new coalescence model, useful in particular for Cosmic Ray applications,
    has been introduced. By considering the list of secondaries produced by a
    string model, it forms deuterons and antideuterons from, respectively,
    proton-neutron and antiproton-antineutron pairs with close momenta.
    By default, the coalescence model is disabled; it can be switched on
    via the UI command <TT>/process/had/enableCRCoalescence true</TT>.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Physics Lists</B>
<UL>
<LI>Enabled charm and bottom hadronic physics in nearly all physics lists,
    in particular those of interest for HEP.
    (The main exceptions are the following physics lists:
    <TT>QGSP_BIC, QGSP_BIC_HP, QGSP_BIC_AllHP</TT>.)
    The QGS-based physics lists use, as for other hadrons, QGSP for
    charm and bottom inelastic interactions above 12 GeV, whereas FTFP
    is used below 25 GeV. The other, FTF-based physics lists, use FTFP
    at all energies, with a simplified approach below 100 MeV.</LI>
<LI>New physics-list builder classes have been introduced to allow
    alternative builders for anti_proton, anti_neutron, hyperons and
    anti-hyperons nuclear interactions at high energies with QGSP.</LI>
<LI>QGS-based physics lists use now QGS for hyperons, anti-hyperons,
    anti_proton and anti_neutron projectiles at energies above 12 GeV.</LI>
<LI>Physics lists that include <TT>G4EmExtraPhysics</TT> use the new
    low-energy gamma-nuclear model (<TT>G4LowEGammaNuclearModel</TT>)
    below 200 MeV (while Bertini cascade is used above 199 MeV up to 6 GeV,
    and QGSP above 3 GeV). The use of this model, its energy threshold and
    the alternative cross section <TT>G4GammaNuclearXS</TT> can be
    configured.</LI>
<LI>Extended EM physics-list configurator interface allowing application of
    extra configuration on top of any available DNA constructor.</LI>
<LI>Cleanup destruction of physics processes at the end of job.
    Reviewed ownership/deletion of physics models at the end of the run.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Visualization and Interfaces</B>
<UL>
<LI>Introduced new alpha-version of a Qt3D visualization driver, based
    on native Qt rendering.</LI>
<LI>Added support for Open Inventor Qt visualisation driver to be built and
    used in applications. The OpenInventor module can be built with either
    the OIQt driver, or with the OIX/OIXE drivers, but not with both.
    Enabled use of OIQt viewer with Qt UI.</LI>

    Design), a turn-key application for radiation analysis and spacecraft
    design.</LI>
<LI>New advanced example HGCal_testbeam based on a Geant4 standalone application
    for the CMS High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCal) studies, to demonstrate a
    test beam setup used in HEP experiments, and as a base for the validation
    studies and comparison with experimental data.</LI>
<LI>New advanced example modelling the ICRP110 reference computational human
    phantoms and calculating the dose in individual voxels and entire
    organs. The human male phantom is created from a whole-body

<UL>
<LI><U>CMake</U>
    <UL>
    <LI>Added support for building PTL external module and introduced
        GEANT4_USE_TBB option, enabling use of TBB as possible alternative
        to builtin PTL tasking.</LI>
    <LI>Added support for Open Inventor Qt visualisation driver to be built and
        used in applications. The OpenInventor module can be built with either
        the OIQt driver, or with the OIX/OIXE drivers, but not with both.
        Added GEANT4_USE_XM to Open Inventor X11 driver code block to correct
        Xm and Xt link order. Improved consistency of using XQuartz vs System
        OpenGL on macOS. Removed obsolete FindInventor module.</LI>
    <LI>Introduced configuration support for Qt3D visualization driver.
        Qt3D driver optional based on find of required Qt5 modules.</LI>
    <LI>Applied patch to allow compilation on Windows using Clang.</LI>
    <LI>Removed requirement on presence of GLU library.
        No longer save GLU related variables in the package cache.</LI>
    <LI>Change shimmed imported target name to VecGeom::vecgeom to match
        upstream usage and reliably use target when available from VecGeom.
        Export VecCore_DIR to package cache when set so that Geant4 behaviour
        is consistent. Co-works with VecGeom-1.1.8.</LI>
    <LI>Updated functions to use G4expat{-static} as custom built targets.</LI>
    <LI>Added GEANT4_BUILD_BUILTIN_BACKTRACE option to enable automatic
        use of G4BackTrace signal handling in G4RunManager.</LI>

        standard than Root when it's installed. Avoid warnings from propagating
        the flag down to tests.</LI>
    <LI>New GEANT4_BUILD_PHP_AS_HP option to enable ParticleHP as HP in physics
        processes. Replaces PHP_AS_HP environment variable. Added PHP_AS_HP
        "feature" in Geant4Config.cmake/geant4-config to allow clients to
        check availability.</LI>
    <LI>Use STRINGS cache property for enum options and CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to
        give easier interface in (G)UIs.</LI>
    <LI>Use "${FOO:-}" variable expansion and "-z" test to check for
        undefined variables in Bourne Shell scripts. Prevents errors when

          material->GetIonisation()->SetMeanEnergyPerIonPair(meanKE).

    <LI>Implemented three time constants for G4Scintillation, and allow
        multiple time constants to work with scintillation by particle type.
        The existing material property names have FAST and SLOW in them, like
        FASTTIMECONSTANT. This doesn't generalize well. Also YIELDRATIO as a
        single value doesn't generalize to three time constants. Proposal is
        to create new names SCINTILLATIONTIMECONSTANT1/2/3 and the same for
        other parameters. The existing names are kept for backwards
        compatibility, with the idea to remove them in the next major release.
        There is a flag in G4Scintillation, with messenger command in the
        OpticalPhysics list, to use the new method:
          /process/optical/scintillation/setEnhancedTimeConstants true.
        Results are unchanged if using same values.
        Allow specifying SCINTILLATIONYIELD only (not requiring
        SCINTILLATIONYIELD1) when only one scintillation channel is present.

        </UL>
        These are the most advanced templated steppers.
        G4TDormandPrince45 provides an endpoint derivative (FSAL) and can be
        used with interpolation.</LI>
    <LI>The second type of templated steppers are non-embedded of 4<SUP>th</SUP>
        and 3<SUP>rd</SUP> order:

        which break up a step into half steps to estimate error, meaning
        they need several additional field evaluation calls than embedded
        steppers of the same order. 
        The reliability of their error estimation has different properties; so
        it may be more robust in some cases. 
        Primarily for comparison and cross-checking of results.</LI>
    <LI>The final available type of low order templated steppers are very low
        order:
        <UL>
        <LI>G4TSimpleRunge: based on G4SimpleRunge, 2<SUP>nd</SUP> order;</LI>
        <LI>G4TExplicitEuler: based on G4ExplicitEuler, 1<SUP>st</SUP> order,
            lowest order (the simplest checks only).</LI>
        </UL>
        only for tests or specialised uses.</LI>
    <LI>Additional intermediate and higher-order steppers are not yet
        available in templated form.</LI>
    <LI>Adapted templated G4TDormandPrince45 for use with G4InterpolationDriver.
        For a stepper to be used with this, it must implement the method
        GetSpecificEquation().
        Templated steppers must provide a return type which is the exact
        equation type of the template.</LI>
    <LI>Experimental versions of fields with inline methods (G4TUniformMagField
        and G4TQuadrupoleMagField) demonstrate how the field evaluation
        GetFieldValue() can also be inlined. Meant for use if the evaluation is
        simple -- and to be avoided if it is complex when inlining it could
        increase the code size significantly. </LI>
    <LI>Configured G4ChordFinder to use templated G4TDormandPrince45 as the
        default stepper for magnetic fields (when one is not chosen explicitly
        by the application). Speed improvement is observed in benchmarks.
        Note: currently it uses the simpler G4InterpolationDriver
        in place of a customised G4BFieldIntegrationDriver which
        multiplexed an interpolation driver for short steps  with a
        helix-based driver for long steps.
        Applications with many <TT>large-angle</TT> steps in magnetic field may
        perform more reliably and faster by restoring the use of the customised
        driver - e.g. by using the G4ChordFinder constructor with <TT>nullptr</TT>
        as third argument and fourth argument <TT>stepperDriverId=4</TT>.</LI>
    <LI>G4VIntegrationDriver and dependent driver classes: added new virtual

    <LI>G4MagInt_Driver: fixed max iterations & clarified that its method
        ComputeNewStepSize() does not (yet) respect maximum reduction factor

        implementation.</LI>
    <LI>G4OldMagIntDriver maintains all old behaviour of G4MagInt_Driver.</LI>
    <LI>In G4MultiLevelLocator, added ability to record in a 'whiteboard',
        the start/end steps of integration intervals, to allow one to diagnose

    <UL>
    <LI>Improved treatment of antibaryon interactions in QGS.
        In G4QGSMFragmentation, corrected the treatment of low-mass
        diquark-antidiquark strings. In addition to this, introduced the Mt
        distribution of produced hadrons.
        In G4VLongitudinalStringDecay, introduced in SetMinimalStringMass()
        a check that the strings are of allowed type: quark-antiquark,
        diquark-antidiquark, quark-diquark and antiquark-antidiquark.
        Introduced also for diquark-antidiquark strings a special algorithm
        (already present for the other types of allowed strings) for treating
        low-mass strings with masses below known hadrons.</LI>
    <LI>Improved agreement of FTF simulations with NA49 experimental data (on
        Pt-Xf correlations for various particles produced in pp interactions at
        158 GeV/c).</LI>
    <LI>In G4QuarkExchange, the reggeon exchanges are now treated as
        annihilation and creation of quark-antiquark pairs (to reflect in
        inelastic processes the non-vacuum reggeon exchanges present in
        antiparticle-particle elastic scattering amplitudes).</LI>
    <LI>G4VLongitudinalStringDecay, G4LundStringFragmentation,
        G4ExcitedStringDecay: inherit from G4HadronicInteraction; destruction
        of these models at the end of run is now done by the hadron model
        store; removed implementations of private operators.</LI>
    <LI>G4VLongitudinalStringDecay: in the method SetMinMasses(), set the
        constituent masses of charm and bottom quarks; introduced also a new
        pre-processor option for debugging heavy hadrons, switched off by
        default; made the logic clearer for Coverity. Code cleanup. Improved
        comments.</LI>
    <LI>G4VStringFragmentation: use inheritance from G4HadronicInteraction;
        removed implementations of private operators.</LI>
    <LI>G4SPBaryonTable: changed return type of the method 'length()' from
        'double' to 'size_t', to fix warnings on Windows.</LI>
    <LI>G4FTFModel: attempt to fix a crash rarely observed in pion+proton
        reaction: added tolerance of 1.e-10 for numerical computation;
        cleaned-up sampling of Pt for residual nucleons (limit argument for
        G4Exp to 200 instead of 1e+9). Extended debug printout; use
        pre-increment instead of post-increment in loops; removed commented
        lines and unused variables.</LI>
    <LI>G4FTFModel, G4FTFParticipants: clean-up: removed unused methods,
        delete operators, use of C++11 keywords.</LI>
    <LI>G4VParticipants, G4VPartonStringModel, G4VStringFragmentation,
        G4StringModel: clean-up; removed unused methods, delete operators,
        use of C++11 keywords.</LI>
    <LI>G4VPartonStringModel: introduced a new pre-processor option for
        debugging heavy hadrons, switched off by default.</LI>
    <LI>G4QGSModel: clean-up; removed unused methods, delete operators, use of
        C++11 keywords, moved inline implementation to source.</LI>
    <LI>G4QGSParticipants: added protection for G4Exp, fixing outstanding
        precision loss in gamma+proton interactions.</LI>
    <LI>G4DiffractiveExcitation: extended to handle heavy (charm and bottom)
        hadrons; introduced also a new pre-processor option for debugging
        heavy hadrons, switched off by default. Added protection against
        inexisting excited hyperon states (Sigma* and Xi*).
        Implemented new splitting of excited hadrons into quark-antiquark or
        quark-diquark in the method CreateStrings().
        Additional code improvements.</LI>
    <LI>G4FTFAnnihilation: removed useless check against inexisting excited
        hyperon states. Added initialization of 2-dimensional arrays as
        suggested by Coverity. Used consistently pre-increment instead of
        post-increment.</LI>
    <LI>G4FTFParameters: extended FTF configuration interface to include
        parameters of quark exchange with and without excitation, for
        baryon and pion projectiles.</LI>
    <LI>G4LundStringFragmentation, G4QGSMFragmentation: if the flag for heavy
        (charmed and bottom) hadrons is enabled, then non-zero probabilities
        for c-cbar and b-bbar creation from the vacuum are set, allowing
        charmed and bottom hadrons to be created during the string fragmentation
        of ordinary (i.e. not heavy) projectile hadron nuclear reactions.</LI>
    <LI>G4LundStringFragmentation: extension to charm and bottom quarks of the
        methods Quark_AntiQuark_lastSplitting() and Quark_Diquark_lastSplitting();
        added protections in the method FragmentString() to avoid rare crashes
        seen with heavy hadrons. Introduced a new parameter (as a class data
        member), a kind of "temperature" for sampling the Pt of produced
        hadrons; this parameter has been tuned for different fragmentation
        processes. The string direction (one of string's properties, whose
        value can be either +1 for projectile-like strings or -1 for target-like
        strings) is now treated correctly and used to invert the results of the
        string fragmentation (in the string rest frame) when the string
        direction is -1.</LI>
    <LI>G4HadronBuilder: fixed condition in the method Barion() to take into
        account the extension to charm and bottom quarks; moreover, for both
        Meson() and Barion() methods, we have to force by hand that the heavy
        hadron produced by the string fragmentation is one of the few available
        in Geant4 (in particular, all heavy hadron resonances are transformed
        into close heavy hadron ground states). Introduced also a new
        pre-processor option for debugging heavy hadrons, switched off by
        default.</LI>
    <LI>G4ExcitedStringDecay: added protection in the FragmentStrings() method
        to avoid rare crashes seen with heavy hadrons.</LI>
    <LI>G4BaryonSplitter, G4SPBaryon: extension to charmed and bottom
        baryons and anti-baryons.</LI>
    <LI>G4SingleDiffractiveExcitation, G4QGSDiffractiveExcitation,
        G4QuarkExchange: in ExciteParticipants() method of these classes,
        extension to charmed and bottom hadrons by assuming a minimum
        projectile diffractive mass equal to the PDG mass plus 250 MeV;
        in G4QuarkExchange, assumed also 50% for the probability of projectile
        diffraction.</LI>
    <LI>G4Reggeons: in the constructor, replaced Omega_cc (PDG code #4432)
        with Omega_c (PDG code #4332); added comments.</LI>
    <LI>G4FragmentingString: erased some inconsistencies.</LI>

<LI><B>QMD</B>
    <UL>
    <LI>G4QMDReaction: added code in ApplyYourself() to get the cross section
        when the projectile is a pion.
        Replaced data member G4PiNuclearCrossSection with G4BGGPionElasticXS
        and G4BGGPionInelasticXS.
        In G4QMDGroundStateNucleus constructor, move the check for proton or
        neutron projectile earlier in the code so that the baryon number can
        be conserved.

    <LI>G4CRCoalescence: new class for applying coalescence to the secondaries
        produced by string model to form deuterons and antideuterons from,
        respectively, proton-neutron and antiproton-antineutron pairs with
        close momenta; useful in particular for Cosmic Ray applications.</LI>
    <LI>G4TheoFSGenerator: introduced temporarily dummy treatment of heavy
        (charm and bottom) projectile hadrons at low energies (below 100 MeV).
        Cascade models are currently not applicable for heavy hadrons and
        string models cannot handle them properly at very low energies, so we
        return as final state the initial state unchanged.
        Note that, for most applications, this is a safe simplification, giving
        that the nearly all slowly moving charm and bottom hadrons decay before
        any hadronic interaction can occur.
        In method ApplyYourself(), apply G4CRCoalescence to the candidate
        secondaries produced by the string model, if the corresponding switch
        is enabled (by default it is disabled).</LI>
