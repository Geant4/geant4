                 Geant4 10.7 - patch-03 Release Notes
                 ------------------------------------

                                                            19 November 2021

List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 10.7.p02:

  o Configuration
    -------------
    + CMake:
      o Renamed Geant4::HDF5 to hdf5::hdf5 to be compatible with imported
        targets provided since CMake 3.20. Addressing problem report #2426.

  o Environments:
    ------------
    + G4py
      o Removed binding to obsolete member functions of G4Sphere and G4Tubs.

  o Geometry:
    --------
    + divisions:
      o Make G4PVDivision and G4ReplicatedSlice inherit from G4PVReplica
        rather than G4VPhysicalVolume, in order to have instances properly
        cloned in MT mode.
      o Fixed bug in G4ParameterisationTrd for positioning calculation.
        Debug messages cleanup.
    + management:
      o Provide operator<<() as a free function for G4UAdapter to support
        Geant4Py.
    + navigation:
      o G4PhantomParameterisation: reduced warning messages in GetReplicaNo()
        function; issue warning only when difference is bigger than
        'kCarTolerance'. Addressing problem report #2314.
    + solids/Boolean:
      o In G4BooleanSolid, use G4RecursiveMutex in place of G4Mutex in
        GetPolyhedron() to avoid potential deadlocks in visualisation
        in recursive Boolean operations.
    + solids/specific:
      o More accurate calculation of distance from point to triangle
        in G4TriangularFacet. Addressing problem report #2401.
      o Added missing accessor in G4UTet.
    + volumes:
      o Use same strategy for cloning solids for replicated volumes types in
        G4GeometryWorkspace (required for having proper treatment of divided
        volumes). Cleanup of unused verbose printouts.
      o G4PVReplica: moved internal defines for MT split data to source.
        Avoid deletion of rotation matrix for replication in Phi in destructor
        as not necessary. Some code cleanup.

  o Global:
    ------
    + Updated date and version for 10.7.p03.

  o Materials:
    ---------
    + Corrected calculations in G4DensityEffectCalculator.
      Addressing problem report #2330.
    + G4IonisParamMat: return exact computations according to the original
      publication. Addressing problem report #2334.

  o Parameterisations/gflash
    ------------------------
    + Fixes in GFlashSamplingShowerParameterisation in the parameters
      definition.

  o Persistency:
    -----------
    + ASCII:
      o Change prefix to free math functions in G4tgrEvaluator source, to avoid
        potential clashes with system functions carrying same name/signature.
        Addressing problem report #2444.
    + GDML
      o G4GDMLWriteStructure: added fatal exception in AssemblyWrite() for the
        case of nested assemblies, not yet supported for exporting.
      o G4GDMLParser: added utility method to retrieve a generic physical
        volume by its name.

  o Physics Lists:
    -------------
    + constructors/gamma_lepto_nuclear
      o G4EmExtraPhysics: enable synchrotron radiation only for really stable
        particles. Fixed typo in registering positron-nuclear process; register
        model for e-/e+-nuclear in case of general processes, avoid registering
        synchroton radiation twice for e-/e+.

  o Processes - Electromagnetic:
    ---------------------------
    + standard
      o G4BetheBlochModel: fixed computation of dedx for alpha if ICRU90 data
        are used. Addressing problem report #2414.
    + utils
      o Fix in G4OpticalParametersMessenger for UI command changing incorrect
        parameter. Addressing problem report #2392.
    + xrays
      o G4Cerenkov: added protection against too small steps (still addressing
        problem report #1992).
      o G4GaussXTRadiator, G4VXTRenergyLoss: added Gauss-distributed regular
        radiator and accessors for angle distribution range.

  o Processes - Hadronic:
    --------------------
    + cross_sections
      o G4NeutronCaptureXS: fixed bug in isotope data access.
    + models/de_excitation
      o In G4PhotonEvaporation, changed de-excitation logic from levels, which
        has no data on transitions: instead of transition to closest level 
        continue transition is performed.
        Attempting fix for problem report #2434, by reducing production of
        fragments with high excitation and high angular momentum.
    + models/particle_hp
      o Bug fix in G4ParticleHPLabAngularEnergy.
    + models/util
      o G4SampleResonance: bug-fix in the method GetMinimumMass() in the use
        case rare and light decay channels (e.g. e+ e-) are included for
        hadronic resonances. Addressing problem report #2299.

  o Run
    ---
    + G4VModularPhysicsList: fixed destruction of the vector of
      G4VPhysicsConstructor for the case when physics list is created
      but physics is not built.

  o Tracking
    --------
    + G4SteppingManager: Making sure Transportation limits the step if a volume
      boundary in a parallel world is co-limiting the step.
      Addressing problem report #2240.

  o Examples:
    --------
    + advanced/ICRP110_HumanPhantoms:
      o Updated URL for data download.
    + advanced/STCyclotron:
      o Added protection against potential division by zero in function
        STCyclotronRun::EndOfRun().
    + extended/hadronic:
      o Hadr01: in HistoManager, DetectorConstruction and DetectorMessenger 
        corrected counting of leaking neutrons.
        Addressing problem report #2441.
    + extended/persistency:
      o G01: Fixed minor overlaps in assembly.gdml and axes.gdml samples.
      o G02, G03: Fixed visualisation settings in input macros.
