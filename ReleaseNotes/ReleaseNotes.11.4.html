<H2>2. Supported CLHEP, VecGeom and PTL versions</H2>

This release of Geant4 has been verified with
<A TARGET="ext" HREF="https://cern.ch/clhep/">CLHEP</A>, release <B>2.4.7.2</B>.
Use of a different CLHEP version may cause incorrect simulation results.<BR>
NOTE: an internal module of the relevant CLHEP classes is provided and can be
used as alternative to an external CLHEP library installation.<BR>
A configuration option allows a Geant4 installation to use the
<A TARGET="ext" HREF="https://gitlab.cern.ch/VecGeom/VecGeom/">VecGeom Library</A>
primitives, to replace the original Geant4 solids.<BR>
VecGeom version <B>2.0.0</B> can be adopted when using such configuration.<BR>
PTL version <B>3.0.1</B> or later is required for external installation of the
<A TARGET="ext" HREF="https://github.com/jrmadsen/PTL">PTL tasking library</A>.<BR>
CMake <B>3.16</B> is the minimum version required to build Geant4.

<H2>3. Items for migration of the user code</H2>

Listed here is some relevant information on developments included in this
release.
Note that for all users a full re-installation of libraries (or a full
re-compilation) and a re-compilation of user applications is required.

<P> </P>
<B>General</B>
<P> </P>
<UL>
<LI>The build of the <TT>G4processes</TT> library has been split into two
    parts, <TT>G4processes_hadronic</TT> for the hadronic part and
    <TT>G4processes_core</TT> for the remainder. <TT>G4processes</TT> remains
    valid as interface through CMake supporting creation of categories that
    are just an interface to other categories.</LI>
<LI>The default configuration now enables use of Qt6 when selecting Qt support
    for visualisation. The user must set <TT>GEANT4_USE_QT_QT5</TT> in
    configuration in order to force find/use of Qt5 instead.</LI>
</UL>

<P> </P>
<B>Electromagnetic and optical physics</B>
<P> </P>
<UL>
<LI>New dataset <TT>G4EMLOW-8.8</TT> is required and should be used.</LI>
</UL>

<P> </P>
<B>Hadronic physics</B>
<P> </P>
<UL>
<LI>New hadronic datasets <TT>G4PhotonEvaporation-6.1.2, G4INCL-1.3,
    G4PARTICLEXS-4.2</TT> are required and should be used.</LI>
<LI>Note that since release 11.3.2, it has been introduced an option to roll
    back the Bertini-like intra-nuclear cascade model (BERT) as it was in
    Geant4 version 11.2. This is possible via the C++ interface:
    <TT>G4HadronicParameters::Instance()->SetBertiniAs11_2(true)</TT>.
    The motivation is that not all thin-target data show consistently that the
    developments in BERT model made in version 11.3 are improving the agreement
    with simulation.</LI>
</UL>

<P> </P>
<B>Run</B>
<UL>
<LI>In G4PhysicsListHelper, changed ordering of processes: for X-Ray production
    using ordering parameter 100 for post step instead of 1000; fixed ordering
    for muon capture at rest.
    This change may affect users' hard-coded physics-lists.</LI>
</UL>

<P> </P>
<B>Visualization and Modeling</B>
<P> </P>
<UL>
<LI>Removed HepRepFile and Qt3D visualisation drivers, no longer viable
    to develop and maintain.</LI>
</UL>

<P> </P>
<B>Data Sets</B>
<P> </P>
<UL>
<LI>This release introduces new data set versions.
    Please see the corresponding details in
    <A href="#data-notes">Section 9</A> of this document.

    <LI>New data set versions: <TT>G4PhotonEvaporation-6.1.2, G4INCL-1.3,
        G4CHANNELING-2.0, G4EMLOW-8.8, G4PARTICLEXS-4.2</TT>.</LI>
    <LI>In order to use <TT>ParticleHP</TT> for charged particles
        (protons, deuterons, tritons, He3 and alphas), an <U>optional</U> data
        set <TT>G4TENDL-1.4</TT> is required, and can be optionally
        downloaded in addition.</LI>
    <LI><U>Optional</U> nuclear data sets for use with the LEND (Low Energy
        Nuclear Data) Cross Section and Model can be optionally downloaded
        here:<BR>

    check mode to check for overlaps in the volume tree without duplication in
    identical logical volumes.</LI>
<LI>Reimplementated the QSS integration methods, improving readability.
    Third order QSS3 method is now available.</LI>
<LI>Revised the default values of parameters in G4FieldParameters, consistent
    with previous practice in the relevant classes' constructors. Added methods
    to access the field, stepper and equation types in G4FieldParameters.</LI>
<LI>Reorganised and enriched comments in headers to follow Doxygen style in
    geometry modules.</LI>
<LI>In G4Box, optimised normal calculation in <TT>DistanceToOut()</TT>.</LI>
<LI>Code optimization in <TT>GetPointOnSurface()</TT> in specific shapes.
    Optimised surface area and cubic volume calculation of several geometrical
    primitives.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Intercoms</B>
<UL>
<LI>New <TT>@@</TT> keyword to be used in UI commands taking a macro file name;
    it allows to create a temporary macro file with the commands being
    defined following it, until a <TT>/control/endRecord</TT> command is
    specified.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Particles</B>
<UL>
<LI>Updated particle properties to PDG-2025.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Electromagnetic physics</B>
<UL>
<LI>Implemented new option to enable/disable fluctuation of energy loss per
    G4Region.</LI>
<LI><U>Optical photons</U>
    <UL>
    <LI>First implementation of the model approach for X-Ray processes
        Cerenkov and Scintillation processes. Their new base class is
        G4VXRayModel.</LI>
    <LI>Build the integral tables only for materials that have non-empty
        material property tables in G4Scintillation and G4Cerenkov.</LI>
    <LI>To enable the generation of a burst of optical photons (via
        scintillation or Cerenkov radiation), and their propagation, created
        new class G4QuasiOpticalPhoton as a G4ParticleDefinition. Defined
        related processes G4QuasiCherenkov and G4QuasiScintillation.</LI>
    <LI>Code refactoring and optimisations in G4OpBoundaryProcess.</LI>
    </UL></LI>
<LI><U>Geant4-DNA</U>
    <UL>

        configuration.</LI>
    <LI>New class G4DNABornIonisationModel, a new implementation of the Born
        model using a new class G4DNASamplingTable, which allows the sharing
        of sampling data between threads.</LI>
    <LI>Extended G4DNAELSEPAElasticModel in G4DNA up to 10 MeV for water.</LI>
    <LI>New class G4ChemReboundTransportation to handle the rebound
        transportation of the molecule.</LI>
    </UL></LI>
<LI>New G4LowPAIH2O model for dE/dx in water for p and e-.</LI>
<LI>Updated Reverse MC simulation to work in MT mode.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Hadronic physics</B>
<UL>
<LI>It is now possible to distinguish quasi-elastic from diffractive tracks
    in the Fritiof (FTF) string model: the method in G4Track
    <TT>GetCreatorModelID()</TT> returns <TT>21350</TT> for FTF quasi-elastic,
    and <TT>21600</TT> for FTF diffraction.<BR>
    Note: for QGS-based physics lists the separate, dedicated quasi-elastic
    model produces tracks with model-ID <TT>21300</TT>; tracks produced by QGS
    have model-ID <TT>22200</TT> (for both diffractive and non-diffractive
    interactions).</LI>
<LI>In G4HadronicProcess, removed warning for the case when K0 and anti-K0
    are transformed into K0S or K0L.</LI>
<LI>Updated algorithms for the integration of probabilities and sampling of
    kinetic energy of the emitted fragments in hadronic de-excitation and
    pre-equilibrium. Expected more accurate spectra.</LI>
<LI>New alternative hadronic de-excitation FermiBreakUp model, G4FermiBreakUpAN,
    and support classes. This alternative option can be enabled via C++
    interface in G4DeexPrecoParameters:
    <TT>SetFermiBreakUpType(G4FermiBreakUpType::bModelAN)</TT>.</LI>
<LI>Extension of the INCLXX model to handle anti-neutron at rest and in-flight.
    This is used by default in INCLXX-based physics lists.</LI>
<LI>In G4ChargeExchange, implemented the angular distribution of pion charge
    exchange according to the V. Lubovitsky parameterisation for different
    reaction channels.</LI>
<LI>Major update of GIDIplus interface in LEND hadronic model, with refactored
    C++ code, including use of official GNDS formatted data. Added feature for
    high-fidelity gamma cascades following reactions such as neutron capture
    and inelastic scattering.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Physics Lists</B>
<UL>
<LI>For the three physics lists QGSP_BIC_HP, QGSP_BIC_HPT and QGSP_BIC_AllHP,
    whereby the electromagnetic physics option 4 is used by default, it is now
    possible to utilise the electromagnetic standard (i.e. option 0) via the
    physics list factory by adding the suffix <TT>_EM0</TT> to their names
    (i.e. QGSP_BIC_HP_EM0, QGSP_BIC_HPT_EM0, and QGSP_BIC_AllHP_EM0).</LI>
<LI>The INCLXX-based physics lists (e.g. FTFP_INCLXX and QGSP_INCLXX) are
    using now INCLXX (instead of FTFP as before) for the annihilation (at rest
    and in-flight) of anti-neutrons.</LI>
<LI>The optional NuDEX nuclear de-excitation model (introduced in Geant4
    version 11.3 only for neutron capture in the physics list QGSP_BERT_HP)
    is available also for neutron capture in the QGSP_BIC_HP and QGSP_BIC_AllHP
    physics lists.</LI>
<LI>Added G4HadronPhysicsLEND in physics-lists to configure neutron and photon
    induced processes from LEND.</LI>
<LI>The G4EmDNABuilder class provides configuration of DNA physics for all
    particles and all standard + DNA configurations.</LI>
<LI>Recommended DNA physics lists are: G4EmDNAPhysics_option2,
    G4EmDNAPhysics_option4, G4EmDNAPhysics_option6, G4EmDNAPhysics_option8.</li>
<LI>For electrons the upper limit of DNA models is <TT>1 MeV</TT>.
    For protons and ions the upper limit of DNA models is <TT>300 MeV/u</TT>.
    For higher energy the standard physics is used.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Visualization and Interfaces</B>
<UL>
<LI>Updated g4tools and ToolsGS visualisation driver to use OpenGL-3.2 when
    co-working with Vtk.</LI>
<LI>First version of generic time windowing of trajectory slices in
    visualisation. Introduced Time Window tab in Qt UI.</LI>
<LI>Introducing RayTracerQt visualisation driver, enabled when GEANT4_USE_QT
    configuration is enabled.</LI>
<LI>Set default configuration to use Qt6 when selecting Qt support.
    User must set GEANT4_USE_QT_QT5 to force find/use of Qt5.</LI>
<LI>Make the TSG driver the "flagship" visualization driver.</LI>
<LI>Re-instated transparency slider in visualization GUI.</LI>
<LI>In G4OpenGLQtViewer, fixed the original pick feature, which was
    inadvertently broken, to show pick info window.</LI>
<LI>General optimization of zoom behavior in visualization when using mouse
    wheel.</LI>
</UL>

<B>Examples</B>
<UL>
<LI>Introduced the CaloDiT pre-trained ML model for fast simulation
    in <I>Par04</I> extended example, offering greater accuracy.</LI>
<LI>New advanced example <I>IAEAphsp</I> demonstrating how to use IAEAphsp
    files as input source (i.e. as a primary generator) and how to produce
    IAEAphsp outputs at given scoring planes. Reference paper:
    M.A. Cortes-Giraldo et al., Int J Radiat Biol 88(1-2): 200-208 (2012).</LI>
<LI>New advanced example <I>microelec_SEY</I> simulating the passage of
    incident electrons [10eV, 10keV] in a stack of 6 layers, where thicknesses
    and material nature can be user defined. The number of electrons re-emitted
    by the irradiated surface is counted by a spherical detector surrounding
    the whole geometry and providing the SEY rate in a csv file as a function
    of the incident energy.</LI>
<LI>New extended example for channeling, <I>ch5</I>, primarily designed to
    simulate positron sources based on oriented crystals.</LI>
<LI>New G4DNA extended examples: <I>microtrack</i>, implementing a geometry to
    calculate microdosimetry quantities for ion tracks in liquid water at a
    given energy, ensuring secondary electron equilibrium when needed;
    <I>molcounters</I>, showing how to use the new molecule counter manager
    system and how to write custom molecule counters; <I>phasespace</I>,

    <LI>G4NeutronInelasticXS, G4ParticleInelasticXS: added download data for
        all elements in class constructor, avoiding lazy initialisation at
        run-time. No locks are set any longer by these cross-section classes.
        For simple applications, the initialisation CPU time increases by
        roughly 10%; no effect on complex applications.</LI>
    <LI>In G4NeutronInelasticXS, G4NeutronElasticXS and G4NeutronCaptureXS,
        split data tables on two parts, low-energy for neutron resonance region
        and high energy above this region. This allows to increase accuracy of
        neutron cross-sections for non-HP (for example, HEP) applications.
        Added extra flag to enable/disable reading and usage of precise data
        in resonance region, allowing to reduce RSS memory for simple
        applications. For applications requiring higher precision of neutron
        transport, the flag should be defined via

    <LI>Re-instated the transparency slider; re-implemented it in a generic way,
        i.e., for all drivers; uses a new UI command:
        <TT>/vis/viewer/set/transparencyByDepth</TT>.
        G4UIQt issues this command on signals from the slider. The user may,
        of course, use this command directly.</LI>
    <LI>Split scene processing into its "permanent" (run-duration models) and
        "transient" (end-of-event and end-of-run models) parts.
        This allows to update just the transient part, e.g., trajectories,
        which we might want to display in a different way, leaving the
        permanent part (e.g., detector) unchanged, avoiding unnecessary
        re-processing. This is exactly the situation for time windowing - the
        detector does not change, the trajectories also actually do not change,
        just the way they are drawn changes.</LI>
    <LI>G4VSceneHandler: introduced <TT>ProcessTransients()</TT> virtual function.
        Moved pertinent code from <TT>ProcessScene()</TT> to
        <TT>ProcessTransients()</TT>.
        Copied time parameters into modeling parameters.
        Calculate and maintain <TT>fMaxGeometryDepth</TT>, new base class data
        member. Enforce the new marker policy in <TT>GetMarkerSize()</TT>.
        Improved some diagnostic printing.</LI>
    <LI>G4VViewer: introduced <TT>ProcessTransients()</TT> method.
        Follow changes in G4PhysicalVolumeModel.
        Initialise <TT>fTransientsNeedRedrawing</TT> to <TT>false</TT>.
        Previously, this was initialised <TT>true</TT>, but it is up to the
        viewer to decide if transients (trajectories) need redrawing.
        Added <TT>ZoomFromMouseWheel()</TT> function to control mouse wheel
        behavior; added virtual methods to get window size, render area size and
        scene near width; implemented ZoomToCursor algorithm to zoom toward the
        mouse cursor. General optimization of zoom behavior with mouse wheel.
        Added Shift key modifier to change zoom mode in perspective projection
        from Dolly (default) to zoomFactor. Changed Shift key modifier behavior
        to enable ZoomToCursor while pressed.
        Added <TT>UpdateGUIControlWidgets()</TT>, <TT>UpdateGUIDrawingStyle()</TT>,
        <TT>UpdateGUIProjectionStyle()</TT> and <TT>UpdateGUITransparencySlider()</TT>
        methods to update the GUI control widgets. Code tidy.</LI>
    <LI>Added RayTracerQt in G4VisExecutive. Introduced nickname/alias TSGZB
        for appropriate driver by priority.
        In Vtk, removed patch as now ToolsSG-GLES builds with OpenGL-3.2.
        Vtk and ToolsSG-GLES can now cowork at run time.</LI>
    <LI>G4VVisCommand: in <TT>InterpolateViews()</TT>, implemented desired time
        per time step. Computation time per step may cause this to increase.</LI>
    <LI>G4VisCommandsViewer: improved guidance of <TT>/vis/viewer/interpolate</TT>
        command. In <TT>/vis/viewer/set/timeWindow/displayHeadTime</TT>,
        implemented "current as default". There might be some minor change of
        behaviour.
        In <TT>/vis/viewer/select</TT>, removed subsequent refresh, even for
        auto-refresh drivers. Refresh is not required after a select, window
        systems keep the image. Added <TT>UpdateGUIControlWidgets()</TT> to
        <TT>G4VisCommandViewerSelect::SetNewValue()</TT> to update the control
        widget when the viewer is changed.</LI>
    <LI>In G4VisCommandsTouchable, disabled <TT>/vis/touchable/centre...</TT> and
        <TT>/twinkle</TT> in the case of large process times.</LI>
    <LI>Added UI command <TT>/vis/scene/add/endOfRunMacro</TT>.
        The macro is executed at end of run and when rebuild required.
        WARNING: some vis commands in the macro cause recursion. Stick to
        simple commmands, e.g., which invoke vis manager <TT>Draw()</TT>

    <LI>G4ViewParameters: added <TT>TransparencyByDepth</TT> and
        <TT>TransparencyByDepthOption</TT>. Simplified code; use single
        TimeParameters from G4ModelingParameters, to replace 18 time window
        parameters. Added <TT>zoomToCursor</TT> parameter to control the zoom
        behavior of the mouse wheel. Added data members and methods to handle
        dots. Changed <TT>GetZoomToCursor()</TT> to <TT>IsZoomToCursor()</TT>
        to follow convention for Boolean parameters.
        Fixed typo to make <TT>/vis/viewer/set/lightsMove cam</TT> behaving

        i.e., dots drawn as filled circles. The vis system is configured by
        default to draw smooth dots. This may be switched off with
        <TT>/vis/viewer/set/dotsSmooth false</TT> and typically this will
        result in square dots.
        Added <TT>/vis/viewer/set/dotsSize and dotsSmooth</TT> commands.
        G4PolyMarkers have a MarkerType that can be dots, circles, or
        squares.</LI>
    <LI>Minor improvement to listing of histograms (if any).

    <LI>G4TrajectoryDrawerUtils: first version of generic time windowing of
        trajectory slices; draws only slices within the viewer time window.
        Note: unless the viewer can handled time-sliced trajectories (only
        OGLS can do this at present), the viewer must request a kernel visit
        on change of viewer time window.
        Trap trajectories with very long global times, e.g, products of
        long-lived radioactive isotopes. Draw as non-time-sliced trajectories.
        Added fading of trajectory slices if time windowing is active; makes
        trajectory slices look like little meteors streaking across the screen.
        Applied clang-format.</LI>
    <LI>G4ModelingParameters: implemented <TT>TimeParameters::operator!=()</TT>.
        Adjusted default values in TimeParameters: set fade factor to 1
        (maximum fading); set head time display 2D x-coordinate to zero
        (centre), while 2D y-coordinate remains at -0.9 (bottom).
        Added struct <TT>TimeParameters</TT>, a prerequisite for "Generic
        Time-Slicing" for the display of the time evolution of events.
        With that feature, the display of tracks moving through time will be
        available to all vis drivers (drivers will still be allowed to
        implement their own time evolution).</LI>
    <LI>G4TrajectoriesModel: in <TT>DescribeYourselfTo()</TT>, draw display
        head time if requested and if time windowing is active; removed
