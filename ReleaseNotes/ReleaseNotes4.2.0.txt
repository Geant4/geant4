       reactions on Hydrogen.
    - processes: added new process for ion induced reactions.
    - models/isotope_production: added model for proton induced isotope
       production, validity range is the proton spallation energy range

       radio-active nuclei and isomeric states. Validity range is the
       range of materials available from ENSDF as of May 2000. To use
       this model a data set is provided in geant4/data/RadiativeDecay
       and the environment variable G4RADIOACTIVEDATA must be set.
    - fixes for memory leaks observed at event loop.

    NOTE: the consistent data sets for photon evaporation and radio-active
          decay (derived from the same version of the ENSDF data) are
	  provided from Web in the source download area. A previous version
	  of photon evaporation data is also provided.

  o Interfaces:

    - Added "compound" commands: /vis/open, /vis/drawVolume.
    - Added ability to visualise boolean solids through G4Polyhedron objects.

      components of composite solids as white forced-wireframe objects.

      o G4GoSceneHandler: correct polyhedron wire-frame in order to remove
        some edges.

1. Supported and Tested Platforms
---------------------------------

  o SUN Solaris 5.6, C++ 4.2 patch 104631-04.
  o HP 10.20, aCC C++ B3910B A.01.23
  o Linux 2.2.12-20, gcc C++ egcs-2.91.66 (egcs 1.1.2).
      This configuration was tested with the RedHat 6.1 distribution, but
      versions of Geant4 have also been compiled successfully on Debian
      and Suse distributions.

Platforms also tested but giving rise to some problems - see below:

  o DEC V4.0, cxx C++ V6.1-027.
  o SUN Solaris 5.6, C++ 5.0 patches 107357-07, 107311-09.

Platforms configured but not yet tested (a patch will follow, if needed):

  o NT 4.0 with Service Pack 4 and Cygnus Tools b20 with:
      Visual C++ 6.0 Service Pack 2

Platforms configured but not tested and not supported:
  o SGI V6.5.5, CC 7.2.1 with ObjectSpace
  o AIX 4.3.2, xlC compiler with ObjectSpace


2. LHC++ and CLHEP 1.5
----------------------

Geant4 2.0 requires the installation of CLHEP 1.5. 

See <A href="http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/lhc++/INSTALLATION/clhep.html">
CLHEP 1.5</A>.  

By default, the CLHEP installation scripts will activate ISO/ANSI C++ features
if the compiler is capable. You need to explicitly disable CLHEP settings in
case you wish non-ISO/ANSI setup on those compilers (for example, DEC).
Note that the installation of the "Hist" package in CLHEP for histogramming
is now disabled by default. If you wish to install CLHEP with the "Hist"
package, you need to edit the CLHEP installation scripts and add the
corresponding entry.

Geant4 2.0 coworks with LHC++ 2.0.0 and components included therein:
  Objectivity 5.2.1 
  ObjectSpace 2.1
  HepODBMS 0.3.1.3 
  CLHEP 1.5.0.0

For more information about LHC++ 2.0.0, see:
  <A href="http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/lhc++/may2000.html">LHC++ 2.0.0</A>
 
3. The Standard Template Library
--------------------------------

The following versions of STL have been tested:

   ObjectSpace STL on
          DEC, HP and SUN.

          See <A href="http://www.objectspace.com/">ObjectSpace</A>.

   "Native" STL on: Linux, HP, DEC and SUN.

This is selected at installation/compile time by the environment variable
G4USE_OSPACE in the case of the former - see documentation.

NOTES:
- Be aware that by default, the installation scripts will expect to use
  the native STL implementation. You must set the G4USE_OSPACE variable
  in the environment in order to select the ObjectSpace implementation.

- Platform specific setup:
  o DEC:   ObjectSpace is required in non ISO/ANSI setup.
           Native STL is required for ISO/ANSI setup.
  o HP:    either ObjectSpace or native STL can be used (non ISO/ANSI setup).
  o SUN:   ObjectSpace is required in non ISO/ANSI setup (CC 4.2).
           Native STL is required for ISO/ANSI setup (CC 5.0 only).
  o Linux: native STL is required (non ISO/ANSI setup).
  o NT:    Native STL and ISO/ANSI setup required.

In the interest of stability, a significant part of the code in Geant4 2.0
still makes use of the "STL Interface" wrapper classes, used for allowing the
migration from Rogue Wave Tools.h++ container library.  For these the emphasis
has remained on correct behaviour, rather than performance.


4. Persistency
--------------

- Platforms

  Persistency in Geant4 2.0 release has been tested on the following
  platforms/software versions:

  G4SYSTEM       OS        C++ compiler   HepODBMS   Objectivity
  ---------  -----------   ------------   ---------  -----------
   SUN-CC    SunOS 5.6      CC 4.2         0.3.1.4      5.2.1
  Linux-g++  Linux  RH6.1   egcs 1.1.2     0.3.1.1      5.2.1

- Known Problems

  There are many warning messages on some platforms during the
  installation of the libraries and the compilation of the examples.
  Most of them can be safely ignored.  It is annoying but hard to get
  rid of them due to various reasons.
  
  For the detail of the warning messages, please refer to the release
  note of Geant4 1.0.


5. Compiler Specific Problems
-----------------------------

  o DEC V4.0, cxx C++ V6.1-027.

    - We have found cases of mis-compilation of min and max templates
      on DEC.  We have traced those which cause serious malfunction
      but there is no guarantee that there are no other cases.
      Detailed inspection of assembler output suggests that this
      problem might not be confined to min and max.  This has been
      reported to DEC/Compaq.  We understand a new version 6.2 of the
      compiler is now available.  However we cannot guarantee correct
      execution of Geant4 on DEC with the current version of the
      compiler.
    - A bug in cin.getline() system function causes an anomalous
      behavior when running in interactive-mode on DEC-cxx 6.1 in
      ISO/ANSI mode. We tested the bug has been fixed in more recent
      versions of the compiler.
      
  o SUN Solaris 5.6, C++ 5.0 patches 107357-07, 107311-09.

      Due to a compiler bug, some code in Geant4 cannot be compiled in
      optimised mode, patches are available from SUN (107357-09, 107311-10)
      which are claimed to fix this problem, we have not been able to test
      them yet. Tests have been performed only by using the debuggable
      version of the libraries.


6. Known Run-Time Problems and Limitations
------------------------------------------

- In the "high energy" hadronic model, a problem of energy non conservation
  has been observed. A fix for it is currently under test and will be
  available soon in a public patch.
- In multiple scattering, the nuclear size correction maybe not well adapted
  for electrons. A fix will come soon.
- The parametrisation of the total cross section for electron bremsstrahlung
  will be reviewed in order to allow generation of gamma below 10 keV.


7. Compilation Warnings
-----------------------

There are compilation warnings on some platforms.  We do not believe
that any will lead to incorrect run-time behaviour, but we are working
on reducing them.


8. Known Run-Time Warnings
--------------------------

The following messages can be written to error output while tracking.  We
believe none give rise to incorrect behaviour.

  o G4PropagateInField: Warning: Particle is looping 
    -  tracking in field will be stopped. 
       It has performed 10000 steps in Field  while a maximum of 10000
       are allowed.
