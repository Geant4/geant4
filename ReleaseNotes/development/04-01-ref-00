    The bug affected the scattering for all the low energy
    (<~ few hundred MeV) heavy particles.

processes/hadronic                      had-V04-00-01
------------------
- General code cleanup to remove some warnings on the various platforms,
  including gcc-3.1.
- cross_sections:
  o Included the high Q2 part of the cross-section into electro and
    photo nuclear reaction cross-sections, and into the equivalent photon
    production.
  o New class for calculating projectile fragment cross-sections in
    ion ion reactions. Implements Physical Review C61, 034607 (2000)
    based on and equivalent to EPAX Version 2, with the kind
    permission of the authors.
- management:
  o Included recoil charge state treatement in HadronicProcess.
  o Bug-fix affecting energy conservation for anti-protons in hydrogene.
- chiral_inv_phase_space: 
  - Included Q2!=0 for gamma and electro nuclear reactions.
  - Using quark-gluon string model now to simulate reactions with large
    energy transfers.
  - Added protection for reactions at threshold.
- coherent_elastic:
  o Improvement for coulomb effects.
  o Correction of array sizes; slightly extends the applicability.
- high_energy:
  o Fix for a long standing problem in phi symmetry traced to the Cross
    method of G4HEVector.
- leading_particle:
  o New package, steming from a partial re-implementation of the MARS
    code. Valid for energies below 5 Gev for proton/neutron/pi+-,
    K+-/gamma/anti_proton
    The code is intrinsically leading particle biased, hence applicable
    for radiation back-ground simulations; no analogue Monte Carlo at
    present. Typical application of this would be in the ESA MOLASSIS
    application.
- low_energy:
  o Correction for randomization of fermi motion (1 in 1000 effect).
  o Better treatement for anti-nucleons through accounting of
    annihilation energy.
  o Various cross-sections in the accounting of nucleons.
  o Improved pi-0 to charged pion rations used in low energy models.
  o Improved treatement of Lorentz transformation, getting rid of the
    1 in 100 phi=0 peak for nucleons.
- neutron_hp:
  o Workaround for a gcc compiler problem.
  o Resolved a problem in the effective luminosity correction
    in the doppler broadening on the fly. Removes a bias in capture time
    on termal neutrons in hydrogen (was off by 10%).
- radiative_decay:
  o Removing a warning.
  o Worked around a linux compiler problem with sort, leading
    to erroneous behavior (from de_excitation).
- de_excitation:
  o Moving the catching of low energy gammas
  o Work-around for a gcc compiler bug; fixes error seen in radiative_decay.
  o Adding a complete set of fresh evaporation code, that is more or
    less equivalent to the GEM evaporation models. It produces fragments up
    to Na25. Currently at beta level. G4Evaporation::SetGEMChannel() method
    should be used to activate this.
- high_energy:
  o Included direct strong resonance decay in case of scattering off
    hydrogen, hence removing this boundary use-case from the cascade
    interface specifications.
- models/management:
  o Added utility interface for nucleus and nuclear density functions,
    for the use of cascade codes.  
- pre_equilibrium:
  o Fixed error in the low energy proton distributions
  o Improvements in the level density.
  o Bug fixed in angular distributions (theta).
  o Added G4NO_ISO_VECDIST flag for platforms with non-ISO STL vector
    distance.
  o Small bug fixed in the equilibrium exciton number.
  o Migration to new pairing corrections.
- quark_gluon_string:
  o Design iteration to enable specialization of participants
    in string excitation.
  o Added gamma nuclear reactions by adding specialised participants for
    this; based on single nucleon participant model, and mesonic structure;
    assuming vector meson dominance in the reactions and splitting.
- util:
  o Added utility for the decay of strong resonances.
  o Added consts to enforce few design considerations.

processes/transportation                transport-V04-00-08
------------------------
- Made weight window sampling to apply only at inital track step 1.
- bug fix in G4ParallelScoreSampler.cc and cleared warning from
  G4ParallelTransport.
- Renamed Manager classes to Sampler classes.
- Bug fix in G4PImportanceWWindowScoreManager.cc
  and G4ParallelImportanceManager.hh.
- Added classes for wieght window biasing.
- G4VProcessPlacer, G4ProcessPlacer:
  o set process vector via process manager not directly. 
  o added member function RemoveProcess() to properly remove a process.
- G4ParallelTranport: use StartTracking to signal inital step.
  This should help to locate "suspended" tracks.

---
- Add G4VModularPhysicsList.cc
