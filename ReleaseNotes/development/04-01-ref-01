                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Critical bug fix in G4PrimaryParticle for initialisation of non
    charged particles.
  o Fix in G4PropagatorInField to correctly handle cases when tracks
    get killed.
  o Performance improvement and fixes in field management.
  o Important bug fixes to cross sections and spectrum for low-energy
    electron processes.
  o Fixes and improvements in hadronic processes for LEP/HEP models,
    management and util triggered by ATLAS/HEC, ATLAS/TILE, and BTEV.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

config                                  config-V04-01-00
------
- Upgraded WIN32-g++ setup to compile with -ansi and gcc-2.95.3 for
  most recent versions of CygWin. 

event                                   event-V04-01-00
-----
- G4PrimaryParticle:
  o Bug fixed in the initialisation of 'charge' for all constructors.

geometry/magneticfield                  field-V04-01-01
----------------------
- G4FieldManager:
  o made 'fDefault_Delta_One_Step_Value' and 
    'fDefault_Delta_Intersection_Val' non static constants to resolve
    initialisation problems. Fixes problem report #383. 
- G4ChordFinder: 
  o in NewStep, fixed case of stepTrial >> stepTrialOld, to take
    large multiple - not small 
  o added guard for stepTrial==0.0 in FindNextChord(). 
- G4MagIntegratorDriver: 
  o added protection against error of 0.0 in ComputeNewStepSize. 
  o cleared warning of unused variable.
- G4EquationOfMotion: 
  o made RightHandSide() an inline method 
  o in GetFieldValue() signature of Point is double[4],
    instead of double[3] 
  o defined G4maximum_number_of_field_components as enum. 
- Updated reference outputs and some other updates to unit tests.

geometry/solids/CSG                     geom-csg-V04-01-00
-------------------
- G4Cons:
  o Bug fixed in DistanceToIn(p,v) concerning z-crossing at
    the edge with Rmin,Rmax.

geometry/solids/STEP                    STEP-V04-01-00
--------------------
- Fixed GNUmakefile to parse 'g++' string in G4SYSTEM to detect
  non-ISO setup for gcc-2.95 and higher.

geometry/solids/STEPinterface           stepinterface-V04-01-00
-----------------------------
- Fixed GNUmakefile to parse 'g++' string in G4SYSTEM to detect
  non-ISO setup for gcc-2.95 and higher.

geometry/verification                   geomver-V04-01-00
---------------------
- G4GeomTestVolume:
  o Fixed recursive call to G4GeomTestVolume to consider also
    'tolerance' as argument in the recursive test algorithm.

geometry/volumes                        geomvol-V04-01-03
----------------
- Code cleanup and cosmetics for most classes.
- G4PropagatorInField:
  o In ComputeStep(), reset status to original by setting 'fNoZeroStep'
    to zero if (fNoZeroStep > fAbandonThreshold_NoZeroSteps).
    Fixes a problem observed in cases when a looping track is killed,
    the bug was causing also subsequent tracks to be killed.
  o Removed not-implemented constructor taking G4Navigator* as argument. 
  o Get rid of static const data for default 'epsilonStep' size. 
  o Initialised all data members in constructor! 

global                                  global-V04-01-00
------
- G4Allocator:
  o Moved page size to become data-member of G4Allocator.
    'fPageSize' is now computed according to the size of the object 
    to be allocated. The default size is 1024 bytes for objects whose
    size is less than 512 bytes, 10 times the size of the object otherwise. 

processes/electromagnetic/lowenergy     emlowen-V04-01-01
-----------------------------------
- Bug fixes to cross sections and spectrum for electron processes. 
- Optimised loading of data in G4AugerData.

processes/hadronic                      ghad-V04-01-00
------------------
- management, utils, models/high_energy:
  o Introduced accounting of strange baryons. 
  o Introduced accounting for anti-nucleons and strange mesons. 
  o Improved treatement of inelasticity for annihilation events and pion 
    absorptive reactions. 
  o Added protection in the call to phase-space method for pion induced
    reactions.
  o Fixed error in energy conservation observed by BTEV. 
    Used to show (1/500) for 1.5-2.5 GeV pion reactions in medium A nuclei. 
- cross-sections:
  o Fixed bug in caching information in gamma nuclear cross-sections
    (G4PhotoNuclearCrossSection).

--------
- Corrected README in exampleN01.
- Updated reference outputs.

tests                                   tests-V04-01-00
-----
- Updated reference outputs.
