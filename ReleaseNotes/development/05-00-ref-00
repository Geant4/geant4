examples                                examples-V04-01-05
--------
- Corrections to messengers for migration to new G4ApplicationState.
- advanced:
  + Migration of most examples to use AIDA 3.X for histogramming.
  + Added "composite_calorimeter" example based on CMS test-beam
    setup (ccal-V04-01-04).
  + Added "lAr_calorimeter" example based on ATLAS lAr-calorimeter test-beam
    setup (lAr_calorimeter-V04-01-03).

- extended
  + analysis (analysisExample-V04-01-01)
    o added "A01" example for usage of analysis and HepRep.
  + biasing (exbiasing-V04-01-01)
    o reduced examples to three:
      o B01 - importance sampling and scoring. Importance values are
        defined according to the mass geometry. Scoring is also performed.
      o B02 - uses a parallel geometry to define G4GeometryCell objects
        for scoring and importance sampling. In addition it customizes
        the scoring. In this example one scorer creates a histogram. It
        can be run through a Python script.
      o B03 - importance sampling and scoring interactively through Python.
  + electromagnetic
    o migrated histogramming to AIDA 3.X.
    o fixes to allow compilation in gcc-3.2 (TestEm1, TestEm2, TestEm3).
  + eventGenerator (exHepMC-V04-01-00)
    o enhanced interface to HepMC to use CLHEP module.
  + geometry/cad (cadex-V04-01-01)
    o enhanced corrections for VERTEX_POINT, EDGE_LOOP and POLY_LOOP in
      g4step_correct.pl script.
  + persistency (PersistencyEx-V04-01-01)
    o introduced example (PersEx01) for persistency of calorimeter hits
      using ROOT-I/O.
    o removed old ODBMS-based examples.
