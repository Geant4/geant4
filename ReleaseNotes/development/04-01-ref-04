                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Fixed PDG codes for particles k0_star(1430), a0(1450) and f0(1370).
  o Bug fixes to ion ionisation in low-energy electromagnetic processes.
  o New angular distribution for multiple scattering and fix to the
    boundary algorithm.
  o Added a cut-off for materials heavier than uranium in neutron
    hadronic model.
  o Implemented DumpInfo() mechanism for solids. Interface change
    required for concrete solids inherited from G4VSolid to implement
    streaming function.
  o Fixes in G4BREPPolycone and specific solids.
  

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

event                                   event-V04-01-03
-----
- Added protection against user's mis-use of destruction of
  G4TrajectoryContainer. By design it was expected that
  G4TrajectoryContainer would be deleted by G4Event destructor,
  after clearAndDestroy() is separately invoked.

geometry/management                     geommng-V04-01-03
-------------------
- Added checks for illegal geometry contructions for G4PVReplica and
  G4PVParameterised. Contructors now verify unicity of daughter volumes
  for replicas and parameterised volumes, as well as checks for attempt
  to replicate/parameterise the world volume. 
- Added new method IsParameterised() for G4PVParameterised and
  G4PVPlacement, to enquire for existing parameterisation for a placed
  volume. 
- Added methods IsParameterised() and GetMultiplicity() for G4PVReplica
  andG4VPhysicalVolume to enquire for existing parameterisation of
  placed volume, and number of replicated volumes.
- Added pure virtual method StreamInfo() in G4VSolid to stream contents
  of a solid to a generic output stream. Interface change required for
  all derived concrete solids.
  Added method DumpInfo() using StreamInfo() to dump contents to the
  standard output. 

geometry/solids                         geomsolids-V04-01-00
---------------
- Implemented mechanism for dumping contents of solids on streams 
  (BREPS solids to be completed still). 
- General cleanup: 
  o removal of characters and uniform indentation of code 
  o inline methods moved to .icc files 
  o reorganised comments for Software Reference Manual.
- Boolean solids:    (geom-bool-V04-01-01)
  o Added method CleanTransformations() to G4DisplacedSolid and
    corrected implementation in destructor of G4BooleanSolid to
    not call for deletion of G4VSolid in the case where displacement
    is used. 
    This fixes a problem noticed on Linux-g++ at application closeout
    for double deletion of a solid in such special case. 
- Specific solids:   (geom-specific-V04-01-01)
  o Fixed un-initialised data members in constructors of classes: 
    G4ClippablePolygon, G4EnclosingCylinder, G4PolyconeSide, 
    G4ReduciblePolygon, G4VCSGfaceted. 
- BREPS solids:      (breps-V04-01-01)
  o Fix in G4BREPSolidPCone in construction for creation of
    begin & end planar surfaces in the case where
    [RMIN[0] == 0.0 && RMAX[0] > 0.0] and/or 
    [RMIN[sections] == 0.0 && RMAX[sections] > 0.0]. 
    Fixes problem report #419. 

particles                               particles-V04-01-00
---------
- Fixed PDG codes for k0_star(1430), a0(1450) and f0(1370).

processes/electromagnetic/lowenergy     emlowen-V04-01-04
-----------------------------------
- Bug fixes for ion ionisation, related to the interaction between
  energy loss and fluorescence.

processes/electromagnetic/standard      stand-V04-01-01
----------------------------------
- PAIxSection and PAIonisation: synchronised HEAD of repository,
  no functional changes.

processes/electromagnetic/utils         utils-V04-01-02
-------------------------------
- Multiple scattering: new angular distribution and minor fix in the
  boundary algorithm. 

processes/hadronic/models/neutron_hp    neu-V04-01-01
------------------------------------
- Added a cut-off for materials heavier than uranium.
- Included unit tests for robustness.

processes/management                    procman-V04-01-00
--------------------
- Added new command /process/setVerbose for G4ProcessTableMessenger.

visualization				vis-V04-01-01
-------------
- OpenGL driver: fixes for WIN32 architecture at compilation level.
  Viewer still to be implemented. 

g3tog4                                  g3tog4-V04-01-00
------
- Fix in G4gsdvn G4gsposp to enable larger number of clone volumes 
- Fix for division defined in a mother with not yet defined parameters. 

examples
--------
- Updated reference outputs

tests
-----
- Updated reference outputs
- test17 (test17-V04-01-00)
  o extended test to cover more use cases - GenericIons, PIXE, Auger.
