    + Fixed compilation warning on gcc-13.1 for array subscript outside array
      bounds in G4ProfilerMessenger::SetNewValue().

  o Interfaces:
    ----------
    + In G4UIQt, replaced use of G4int by int in QT signal/slots.

  o Particles:
    ---------
    + Updated mean lifetime values of G4XicZero and G4AntiXicZero according to
      values in PDG-2022. Corrected values for G4[Anti]OmegacZero.

  o Persistency:
    -----------
    + gdml
      o Fixed cases of failure in exporting tessellated solids: make
        G4ThreeVectorCompare:operator(v1,v2) obey the strict weak ordering
        requirements.

  o Physics Lists:
    -------------
    + builders
      o G4HadronicBuilder: fixed bug in method BuildKaonsFTFQGSP_BERT().

  o Processes - Electromagnetic:
    ---------------------------
    + highenergy
      o G4GammaConversionToMuons: fixed FPE exception in compound, when
        selecting element and addressed cross-section factor issue responsible
        for differences in muon/pion production.
        Addressing problem report #2543.
    + muons
      o G4MuBremsstrahlung, G4MuPairProduction: fixed setting of Spline flag,
        which was lost for mu-, pi-, K-, pbar dedx and range tables; the
        problem was mostly observed for mu- with momentum ~50 MeV/c, ~5 %
        biased range. Addressing problem report #2531.
      o G4MuBetheBlochModel: enabled option to use angular generator for
        sampling of delta-electron direction.
      o G4MuIonisation: implemented full schema of selection of the model of
        energy loss fluctuation.
    + standard
      o G4WentzelOKandVIxSection: fixed numeric instability for the extreme
        case of very small kinetic energy (< 1 eV). Improved comments and
        fixed single scattering per region. Addressing problem report #2530.
      o G4LinhardSorensenModel: updating effective charge of an ion at each
        step of simulation or at each call to G4EmCalculator; added extra
        protection and improved debug printout.
        Avoid use of ICRU73 data for projectile Z>80.
    + utils
      o G4EmExtraParameters: fixed AddPAIModel() method and improved comments.
      o G4EmExtraParametersMessenger: fixed broadcasting.
      o Allow "/process/em/QuantumEntanglement" UI command in G4State_Idle.
      o Fixed Coverity warning in G4VEnergyLossProcess.
      o G4EmTableUtil: fixed verbose output and class comments.
      o G4LossTableManager: improved debug printout and removed unused code.
      o Fixes to G4TransportationWithMsc: protected code for MultipleScattering;
        fixed type of particle change.

  o Processes - Hadronic:
    --------------------
    + models/cascade
      o G4BigBanger: added protection in the method generateBangInSCM() to
        avoid very rare cases of unphysical negative energy of one of the
        secondaries produced by the Bertini model.
        The problem was reported by ATLAS in production runs based on
        release 10.6; the secondaries with negative (both total and kinetic)
        energy were always neutrons, produced by the internal Bertini nuclear
        de-excitation, after the intra-nuclear cascade.
    + models/inclxx
      o G4INCLNNToNLK2piChannel: fixed bug in the method fillFinalState().
    + models/particle_hp
      o Added G4ParticleHPNucLevel, new data structure for nuclear levels.
      o G4ParticleHPDeExGammas: rewritten in order to avoid usage of C-arrays
        and use std::vector instead; public interfaces are unchanged; if in DB
        probability of decay for a give level is zero; it is substituted to
        1.e-6.
      o G4ParticleHPInelasticBaseFS, G4ParticleHPInelasticCompFS: gamma
        cascade sampling is checked and simplified (removed unnecessary
        computations).
    + util
      o G4Fragment: replaced G4HadronicException with standard G4Exception.

  o Processes - Parameterisation:
    ----------------------------
    + Added missing virtual destructor to G4VFastSimSensitiveDetector.

  o Run:
    ---
    + Removed mistyped method declaration GetMasterTheadId() in G4MTRunManager.

  o Examples:
    --------
    + extended/geometry/vecGeomNavigation
      o Stick to G4VecGeomNav package v0.2.1, compatible with VecGeom v1 series.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
