                 Geant4 11.0 - patch-04 Release Notes
                 ------------------------------------

                                                            3 March 2023

List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 11.0.3:

  o Configuration
    -------------
    + CMake:
      o Removed no longer required G4VecGeomShim module.
        VecGeom supports/supplies full imported targets since 1.1.18
        Use of VECGEOM_LIBRARIES variable is required to allow build against
        CUDA-enabled VecGeom.

  o Analysis
    --------
    + Added a protection against nullptr in G4VAnalysisManager::GetNofNtuples()
      Addressing problem report #2518.
    + Do not remove non-empty HDF5 output files.

  o Global:
    ------
    + Updated date and version for 11.0.4.

  o Materials:
    ---------
    + G4Material: added an extra check on number of atoms in method
      AddElementByNumberOfAtoms(..). Addressing problem report #2514.

  o Particles:
    ---------
    + G4XicZero, G4AntiXicZero, G4OmegacZero, G4AntiOmegacZero: updated mean
      lifetime values according to PDG-2022.
    + G4Triton, G4AntiTriton: corrected the lifetime value for triton and
      anti_triton. The half-life (12.32 years) was incorrectly used instead of
      the mean lifetime (17.774 years) for triton, whereas the anti_triton was
      incorrectly treated as stable.
    + G4AntiNeutron: set the "PDG stable" flag to "false", as for G4Neutron.
      This has no practical consequences, i.e. anti_neutron decays regardless
      of this flag.

  o Physics Lists:
    -------------
    + constructors/decay
      o G4RadioactiveDecayPhysics: assigned RadioactiveDecay process to G4Triton
        (which is the only light ion that decays). Note: before, triton did not
        have beta decay, i.e. it was wrongly treated as stable even when
        radioactive decay physics was enabled; anti_triton did not, and still
        does not, have beta decay (because RadioactiveDecay, in its current
        implementation, does not handle any kind of anti-ions): in practice,
        this is an acceptable approximation because of its relatively long
        lifetime and the fact that annihilation and nuclear capture are more
        likely to happen before decay.

  o Processes - Electromagnetic:
    ---------------------------
    + standard:
      o G4WentzelOKandVIxSection: fixed numeric instability for the extreme
        case of very small kinetic energy (< 1 eV). Improved comments and
        fixed single scattering per region. Addressing problem report #2530.

  o Processes - Hadronic:
    --------------------
    + cross_sections:
      o G4ComponentAntiNuclNuclearXS: fix and extension in methods
        GetTotalElementCrossSection() and GetInelasticElementCrossSection();
        a bug was causing undefined values for, respectively, the total and
        inelastic cross-sections of anti-proton interactions with light target
        nuclei (d, H3, He3 and He4).
      o G4NeutronInelasticXS, G4ParticleInelasticXS: fixed computation of 
        isotope cross-sections. Addressing problem report #2498.
    + models/cascade
      o G4NumIntTwoBodyAngDst: corrected incomplete initialization of a vector.
        Addressing problem report #2515.
      o G4TwoBodyAngularDist: corrected the charge exchange reaction of pion+
        on neutron producing in the final state pion0 and proton.
        Addressing problem report #2516.
    + models/lepto_nuclear
      o G4ElectroVDNuclearModel: added protections against null pointers to
        gamma cross-section and material, responsible for rare crashes.
    + models/particle_hp
      o G4ParticleHPContAngularPar: added protection against zero probability
        for both discrete and continuous emission.
    + models/parton_string
      o G4DiffractiveSplitableHadron: fixed rare large energy violations seen
        with FTF when dealing with charm and bottom hadron nuclear interactions.
      o G4LundStringFragmentation, G4QGSMFragmentation: corrected value for
        the probability of charm/anti-charm creation from the vacuum (a factor
        of 10 higher was set to enhance the production of charm hadrons for
        testing purposes).
      o G4QGSMFragmentation: bug-fix in the method GetLightConeZ(), which
        might cause rare access to arrays with a wrong index.
    + util
      o G4Nucleus: corrected method GetN_asInt() for the case of hypernuclei.
