       removed wrappers for hash dictionaries; reorganised classes/files.
    - management:
       introduced 'g4std' wrappers and keywords for migration to the ISO/ANSI
       C++ standard and usage of the std namespace; fixed minor bug in
       G4PhysicsVector.

1. Supported and Tested Platforms
---------------------------------

  o SUN Solaris 5.6, C++ 4.2 patch 104631-04.
  o HP 10.20, aCC C++ B3910B A.01.18  or  A.01.21
  o Linux 2.0.35, gcc C++ egcs-2.91.66 (egcs 1.1.2).
      This configuration was tested in the RedHat 5.1 distribution, but
      versions of Geant4 have also been compiled successfully on RedHat 6.1,
      Debian and Suse distributions.

Platforms also tested but giving rise to some problems - see below:

  o DEC V4.0, cxx C++ V6.1-027.
  o NT 4.0 with Service Pack 4 and Cygnus Tools b20 with:
      Visual C++ 6.0 Service Pack 2

Platforms configured but not tested and not supported:
  o SGI V6.5.5, CC 7.2.1 with ObjectSpace
  o AIX 4.3.2, xlC compiler with ObjectSpace

2. CLHEP 1.4
------------

Geant4 1.0 requires the installation of <A
href="http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/lhc++/INSTALLATION/clhep.html">CLHEP
1.4</A>.  The following platform specific instructions apply:

  DEC: Do *not* use the compiler option "-std strict_ansi".

  NT: After configure, edit the file config/CLHEP-x86-cygnus-win32
      and comment out "#define HEP-USE-STD 1".



3. The Standard Template Library
--------------------------------

The following versions of STL have been tested:

   <A href="http://www.objectspace.com/">ObjectSpace</A> STL on: 
          DEC, HP, NT and SUN.

   "Native" STL on: Linux, HP.

This is selected at installation/compile time by the environment variable
G4USE_OSPACE in the case of the former - see documentation.

NOTES:
- Be aware that by default, the installation scripts will expect to use
  the native STL implementation. You must set the G4USE_OSPACE variable
  in the environment in order to select the ObjectSpace implementation.
- Platform specific setup:
  o DEC: ObjectSpace is required for non-ISO/ANSI-compliant code.
         Native STL will be used for ISO/ANSI installation (future patch
	 or minor release).
  o HP:  either ObjectSpace or native STL can be used for non-ISO/ANSI-
         compliant code. The default setup for native STL will trigger by
	 default the ISO/ANSI installation (set G4NO_STD_NAMESPACE in the
	 environment to avoid that).
  o SUN: ObjectSpace is required (non-ISO/ANSI installation).
         Support for CC 5.0 compiler and native STL (ISO/ANSI installation)
	 will be added soon (future patch or minor release).
  o Linux: native STL is required (non-ISO/ANSI installation).
  o NT:  ObjectSpace is required (non-ISO/ANSI installation).
         Support for native STL and ISO/ANSI installation will be added
	 soon (future patch or minor release).

Geant4 1.0 is the first release requiring the Standard Template Library.
To allow a smooth transition from Rogue Wave containers to STL, a good part
of the code still makes use of the "STL Interface" wrapper classes for which
the emphasis has been on correct behaviour, not on performance. Also, the
size of libraries and executables may appear considerably larger than the
previous Rogue-Wave based versions.


4. Persistency
--------------

- Platforms

  Persistency in Geant4 1.0 release has been tested on the following
  platforms/software versions:

  G4SYSTEM       OS        C++ compiler   HepODBMS   Objectivity
  ---------  -----------   ------------   ---------  -----------
   SUN-CC    SunOS 5.6      CC 4.2         0.3.1.0      5.2
   HP-aCC    HP-UX 10.20    aCC A.01.18    0.3.0.1      5.1.2
  Linux-g++  Linux  RH5.1   egcs 1.1.2     0.3.0.1      5.1.2
           
  A patch to run persistency examples on DEC-cxx will be released
  later, pending a fix to HepODBMS library.

- Known Problems

  1) The following warning messages appear on some platforms during the
     installation of the libraries and the compilation of the example
     files. The message comes from the parser of the Objectivity
     preprocessor. It can be ignored.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  "/opt/SUNWspro/SC4.2/include/CC/generic.h", line 29: warning: omission of
            explicit type is nonstandard ("int" assumed)
    extern genericerror(int, char*);
           ^
  "/opt/SUNWspro/SC4.2/include/CC/iostream.h", line 781: warning: integer
            conversion resulted in a change of sign
          unsafe_istream& wignore(int=1, wchar_t=WEOF);
                                                 ^
  "/opt/SUNWspro/SC4.2/include/CC/iostream.h", line 962: warning: integer
            conversion resulted in a change of sign
          istream& wignore(int=1, wchar_t=WEOF);
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

  2) The following warning messages appear during the installation of the
     library. This is due to a design choice of the persitent object
     and it can be safely ignored.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  warning: persistent-capable class member type is a problem
            The type of base class vector<G4VPhysicalVolume * > is a problem
            The type of member vector<G4VPhysicalVolume * >::start_ is pointer
            The type of member vector<G4VPhysicalVolume * >::finish_ is pointer
            The type of member vector<G4VPhysicalVolume * >::end_of_storage_
                      is pointer
            The type of member vector<G4VPhysicalVolume * >::alloc_ is a
                      problem
            The type of member allocator<G4VPhysicalVolume * >::impl_ is
                      pointer
        G4VPhysVolRefVArray  transPhysVolPtrs;
                                             ^
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

  3) The following warning messages appears during the installation of the
     libraries and the compileation of the example files.  Dependency
     file is used to solve the GNUmake dependencies inside the Geant4
     categories and it can be safely ignored.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  In file included from /afs/cern.ch/sw/lhcxx/specific/@sys/HepODBMS/0.3.1.0/
  include/HepODBMS/odbms/HepODBMS.h:75,
                 from include/G4PersistentTypes.hh:21,
                 from include/G4VPersistentSubMan.hh:34,
                 from src/G4VPersistentSubMan.cc:16:
  /afs/cern.ch/sw/lhcxx/specific/sun/Objectivity/5.2/include/oo.h:57:
  warning: No include path in which to find generic.h
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

  4) The following error messages appear at the end of the library
     installation, and it can be safely ignored.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  installing schema header files ...
  cp: cannot access /afs/cern.ch/sw/geant4/stt/ref+/AIX-xlC/debug/persistency/
  STL/tmp/SUN-CC/G4pglobal/*.hh
    schema header file does not exist, so ignore the error message...
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

  5) The following warning message appears at the runtime of the persistency
     examples, which is generaged by HepDbApplication in HepODBMS.
     It can be ignored.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Opening federated database OO_FD_BOOT.
  WARNING: g4example: Could not find naming root directory:
  Naming will be disabled.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. Compiler Specific Problems
-----------------------------

  o DEC V4.0, cxx C++ V6.1-027.

      We have found cases of mis-compilation of min and max templates
      on DEC.  We have traced those which cause serious malfunction
      but there is no guarantee that there are no other cases.
      Detailed inspection of assembler output suggests that this
      problem might not be confined to min and max.  This has been
      reported to DEC/Compaq.  We understand a new version 6.2 of the
      compiler is now available.  However we cannot guarantee correct
      execution of Geant4 on DEC with the current version of the
      compiler.

  o NT

      - Due to limitations of the VC++ optimiser, testing was done using
        the debuggable version only.
      - g3tog4 has not been ported to NT.
      - During the making of dependency files during compilation there
          are repeated warnings ("Strstrea.h not found") - this is an
          artefact of using g++ for this purpose.
      - Ignore linker warnings: "conflicts with use of other libs".
      - Ignore linker errors: "unresolved external symbol
          __imp__MessageBoxA@16". 


6. Known Run-Time Problems
--------------------------

  o Reading STEP files on DEC with optimised libraries causes a Memory
    fault - but see notes on DEC above.
  o In rare cases heavy ions appear not to be properly stopped and killed
    in tracking, therefore Geant4 sticks making many small steps. This
    behavior has been observed on SUN and is under investigation.
  o There is a known problem reading the data files specified by
    environment variable G4LEVELGAMMADATA (usually
    $G4INSTALL/geant4/data/PhotonEvaporation).  A patch resolving this
    problem will be issued soon.


7. Compilation Warnings
-----------------------

There are compilation warnings on some platforms.  We do not believe
that any will lead to incorrect run-time behaviour, but we are working
on reducing them.


8. Known Run-Time Warnings
--------------------------

The following messages are written to error output while tracking.  We
believe none give rise to incorrect behaviour.

  o G4PropagatorInField::LocateIntersectionPoint: Warning: Integration
      inaccuracy requires an adjustment in the step's endpoint Two
      mid-points are further apart than their curve length difference:
      Dist = xxx curve length = yyy
  o Warning in G4Navigator::ComputeStep: The Step's starting point has
      moved...
  o SOME WORDS ABOUT exampleN02 and muons !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
