    + CMake:
      o Fix for CPack on Windows to avoid PATH with only '/', without '\'.
      o Don't add CLHEP_INCLUDE_DIRS directly through include_directories
        to prevent potential issues with it holding relative paths.

    ---------
    + CLHEP:
      o Fixed compilation warnings on macOS in LorentzRotation header

  o Geometry:
    --------
    + management:
      o G4SolidStore, G4LogicalVolumeStore, G4PhysicalVolumeStore:
        extend getter methods to optionally return the last-found object.
    + navigation:
      o G4RegularNavigation: reset the zero step counter when a non-zero step
        is performed, to avoid aborted events. Removed tabs in source code.
        Based on GitHub PR#38 (https://github.com/Geant4/geant4/pull/38).
      o G4VIntersectionLocator: fixed compilation warning for unused data.

        Minor optimisation in constructors and in caching half-tolerance.

  o Global:
    ------
    + Replaced use of deprecated std::result_of with std::invoke_result_t,
      fixes compilation warnings on Apple clang version 13.1.6.

      arrays of fractions are created, filled and temporary vectors are deleted,
      as a result the code become more transparent.
