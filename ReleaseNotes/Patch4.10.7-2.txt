        Based on findings in GitHub PR#24.
    + GDML
      o G4GDMLReadSolids: updated optical surface properties to reflect
        introduction of DAVIS interface. Addressing problem report #2371.
      o Removed hardcoded size 10000 in G4GDMLWrite causing the values in GDML
        truncated. Adressing problem report #2336.
      o Fixed case of writing degenerated names (position, rotation and nodes)
        for multiUnion and assembly entities. Addressing problem report #2342.
      o Fixed problem of not complete writing of assemblies to GDML file.
        Addressing problem report #2343.

  o Physics Lists:
    -------------
    + constructors/electromagnetic
      o G4EmBuilder: added geantinos to the minimal list of EM particles.
      o GeneralGammaProcess: reduced usage of protected variables.
      o G4EmStandardPhysics, G4EmStandardPhysicsGS: set default verbosity to 1.
    + constructors/hadron_inelastic
      o G4HadronPhysicsShielding: corrected parameters of the M variant
        of the Shielding physics list.
    + lists
      o Updated list of EM extension shorthands known to extensible factory to
        match old factory.

  o Processes - Electromagnetic:
    ---------------------------
    + muons
      o G4EnergyLossForExtrapolator, G4TablesForExtrapolator: allow several runs
        with extrapolator; fixed extrapolation for hadrons.
        More thread safe initialisation and destruction.
    + utils
      o G4EmParameters: fixed line breaking in printouts.
        Addressing problem report #2350.
      o Fixed shadowing compilation warning in G4EmCorrections on gcc-11.
    + xrays
      o G4Scintillation: changed 'IsApplicable' to all particles except
        optical-photon and short-lived. Addressing problem report #2372.

  o Processes - Hadronic:
    --------------------
    + models/de_excitation
      o G4DeexPrecoParameters: changed half-life time threshold for isomer
        production from 1 microsecond to 1 nanosecond.
        The goal is to avoid unphysical missing energy cases as reported by
        NA61/SHINE Collaboration.
        Fixed line breaking in printouts. Addressing problem report #2350.
      o G4PolarizationTransition: fixed sampling of angular correlations.
        Addressing problem report #2344.

      o Fixed condition in G4ParticleHPInelasticCompFS:::CompositeApply().
        Addressing problem report #2333.
    + radioactive_decay
      o G4RadioactiveDecayBase: set the weight of secondaries tracks to the
        mother's weight value in the method G4RadioactiveDecayBase::DecayAnalog().
        This bug, present since a long time, affects only simulations that use
        Radioactive Decay in analogue mode with "external" biasing (e.g. generic
        biasing, GPS generator with weights, etc.).
        Corresponding fix was done also in deprecated class G4RadioactiveDecay.
        Fixed line breaking in printouts. Addressing problem report #2350.

  o Processes - Management
    ----------------------
    + G4ProcessTable: added missing checks, protecting against null elements.

  o Examples:
    --------
    + advanced/gammaknife:
      o Use default MixMax random number engine.
      o Fixed interactive run to just execute defaultMacro.mac.
      o Added forgotten header in GammaKnifePhysicsList.
    + advanced/purging_magnet:
      o Removed call to obsolete ResetCuts() in PurgMagPhysicsList.
    + advanced/STCyclotron:
      o Update README to recommend correct version of G4TENDL-1.3.2.
        Addressing problem report #2341.
      o Fixed gui.mac macro to invoke init_parameters.mac.
        Addressing GitHub PR#25.
    + advanced/xray_telescope:
      o Removed calls to obsolete ResetCuts() in XrayTelPhysicsList.
    + extended/hadronic/Hadr02:
      o Migrated to newer CRMC and more modern approach to physics lists.
    + extended/hadronic/FissionFragment:
      o Fixed CMake build script to define target properly.
      o Improved comments.
    + extended/medical/GammaTherapy:
      o Use default MixMax generator instead of obsolete RanecuEngine.
