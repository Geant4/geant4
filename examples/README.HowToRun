                 How to build and run an example
                 -------------------------------

 All basic and most of extended examples have a similar structure.
 The main () function is included in exampleXYZ.cc in the example top directory
 and the example source code is structered in include and src subdirectories.
 When the example is built, the executable takes the same name as the file with
 main() function without .cc extension, exampleXYZ.

 Then several macros are provided to run the example with various start-up
 conditions. These macros have usually .mac extension. Besides these macros,
 there is often a macro exampleXYZ.in (note its different extension)
 which is used in Geant4 testing and which output, exampleXYZ.out, can also included
 in the distribution.

 You can find all details about building the examples in the Geant4 Installation Guide:
 "https://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/UsersGuides/InstallationGuide/html/index.html"
 in the section How to Use the Geant4 Toolkit Libraries:
 https://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/UsersGuides/InstallationGuide/html/buildtools.html"
 Here we recall only the basics. 

 1) COMPILE AND LINK TO GENERATE AN EXECUTABLE

       % cd path_to_exampleXYZ     # go to directory which contains your example
       % mkdir exampleXYZ_build
       % cd exampleXYZ_build
       % cmake -DGeant4_DIR=path_to_Geant4_installation/lib[64]/Geant4-11.0.0/ ../exampleXYZ
       % make -j N exampleXYZ      # "N" is the number of processes
       % make install              # this step is optional

 2) EXECUTE EXAMPLEXYZ IN 'BATCH' MODE FROM MACRO FILES
 		
       ... go to the directory where the example was built/installed
       % ./exampleXYZ  xyz.mac
 		
 3) EXECUTE EXAMPLEXYZ IN 'INTERACTIVE MODE' WITH VISUALIZATION

       ... go to the directory where the example was built/installed
       % ./exampleXYZ
       ....
       Idle> type your commands
       ....
       Idle> exit


 Below we give the explicit instructions for the example 
 extended/electromagnetic/TestEm1. 

 Let's suppose that the TestEm1 directory is available in $HOME and Geant4 
 installation in /usr/local and we work within bash shell on a 64-bit machine.

 1) COMPILE AND LINK TESTEM1 TO GENERATE AN EXECUTABLE

    % cd $HOME
    % mkdir TestEm1_build
    % cd TestEm1_build
    % cmake -DGeant4_DIR=/usr/local/lib64/Geant4-11.0.0/ ../TestEm1
    % make -j 2 TestEm1

 2) EXECUTE TESTEM1 IN 'BATCH' MODE FROM MACRO FILES

    % cd $HOME/TestEm1_build    # or cd $HOME/TestEm1 if example was built with GNUmake
    % ./TestEm1 annihil.mac
    % ./TestEm1 brem.mac
    % ./TestEm1 TestEm1.in >& myTestEm1.out   # redirecting output in a file
 	 	
 3) EXECUTE TESTEM1 IN 'INTERACTIVE MODE' WITH VISUALIZATION

    % cd $HOME/TestEm1_build    # or cd $HOME/TestEm1 if example was built with GNUmake
    % ./TestEm1
    PreInit> /run/initialize 
    Idle>    /run/beamOn 1
    ...
    Idle>    exit
