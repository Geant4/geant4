/*! \page README_HowToRun How to build and run an example

All basic and most of extended examples have a similar structure.
The main () function is included in \em exampleXYZ.cc in the example top directory
and the example source code is structered in \em include and \em src subdirectories.
When the example is built, the executable takes the same name as the file with
main () function without \em .cc extension, \em exampleXYZ.

Then several macros are provided to run the example with various start-up
conditions. These macros have usually \em .mac extension. Besides these macros,
there is often a macro \em exampleXYZ.in (note its different extension)
which is used in Geant4 testing and which output, \em exampleXYZ.out, can be also included
in the distribution.

You can find all details about building the examples in the <a href= "https://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/UsersGuides/InstallationGuide/html/index.html"> Geant4 Installation Guide </a>, in the section <a href="https://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/UsersGuides/InstallationGuide/html/buildtools.html">  How to Use the Geant4 Toolkit Libraries </a>.
Here we recall only the basics. 

\section HowToRun_s1 Compile and link to generate an executable

\verbatim
% cd path_to_exampleXYZ     # go to directory which contains your example
% mkdir exampleXYZ_build
% cd exampleXYZ_build
% cmake -DGeant4_DIR=path_to_Geant4_installation/lib[64]/Geant4-11.0.0/ ../exampleXYZ
% make -j N exampleXYZ      # "N" is the number of processes 
% make install              # this step is optional              
\endverbatim


\section HowToRun_s2 Execute exampleXYZ in 'batch' mode from macro files
 		
\verbatim
... go to the directory where the example was built/installed
% ./exampleXYZ  xyz.mac
\endverbatim
 		
\section HowToRun_s3 Execute exampleXYZ in 'interactive mode' with visualization
\verbatim
... go to the directory where the example was built/installed
% ./exampleXYZ
....
Idle> type your commands

Idle> exit
\endverbatim

/*! \page README_HowToRunTestEm1 How to build and run TestEm1 example

Below we give the explicit instructions (described in general at \ref README_HowToRun page) for the example extended/electromagnetic/TestEm1.

Let's suppose that the \em TestEm1 directory is available in $HOME and Geant4 installation in \em /usr/local and we work within the \em bash shell on a \em 64-bit machine.

\section HowToRunTestEm1_s1 Compile and link TestEm1 to generate an executable

\verbatim
% cd $HOME
% mkdir TestEm1_build
% cd TestEm1_build
% cmake -DGeant4_DIR=/usr/local/lib64/Geant4-11.0.0/ ../TestEm1
% make -j 2 TestEm1
\endverbatim

\section HowToRunTestEm1_s2 Execute TestEm1 in 'batch' mode from macro files
\verbatim
% cd $HOME/TestEm1_build    # or cd $HOME/TestEm1 if example was built with GNUmake
% ./TestEm1 annihil.mac
% ./TestEm1 brem.mac
% ./TestEm1 TestEm1.in >& myTestEm1.out   # redirecting output in a file
\endverbatim
 		
\section HowToRunTestEm1_s3 Execute TestEm1 in 'interactive mode' with visualization
\verbatim
% cd $HOME/TestEm1_build    # or cd $HOME/TestEm1 if example was built with GNUmake
% ./TestEm1
PreInit> /run/initialize 
Idle>    /run/beamOn 1
...
Idle>    exit
\endverbatim
