                    Example B3 History file
                    -----------------------
This file should be used by the G4 example coordinator to briefly
summarize all major modifications introduced in the code and keep
track of all tags.

     ----------------------------------------------------------

08/05/18 B. Morgan     (exampleB3-V10-04-00)
- Include G4Types before use of G4MULTITHREADED. For forward
  compatibility with move to #defines over -D for G4 preprocessor
  symbols.

22/12/16 M. Maire      (exampleB3-V10-03-00)
- PhysicsList : register Electromagnetic before RadioactiveDecay


19/11/16 A. Dotti      (exampleB3-V10-02-04)
- explicit set of SD to manager

02/11/16 I. Hrivnacova (exampleB3-V10-02-03)
- Fixed comments for Doxygen
- Removed obsolete B3b/exampleB3.cc

26/09/16 I. Hrivnacova (exampleB3-V10-02-02)
- Updated for renaming G4Parameter in G4Accumulable

24/05/16 I. Hrivnacova (exampleB3-V10-02-01)
- Fixed compiler warning introduced in the previous update

20/05/16 I. Hrivnacova (exampleB3-V10-02-00)
- Fixed initialization of the hits collections IDs in B3aEventAction
  (this fixes the problem report #1862)
- Removed History files from B3a and B3b

05/11/15 I. Hrivnacova (exampleB3-V10-01-01)
- Splitting example in two variants of merging data:
  -B3a (new) with the code based on G4Parameter 
  -B3b (as previous B3) with the code based on G4Run

04/05/15 I. Hrivnacova (exampleB3-V10-01-00)
- Coding guidelines: removed empty lines
     
29/11/14 I. Hrivnacova
- Use G4endl instead of \n in G4cout;
  this makes each new line in the output on threads preceded with
  G4WTN >

06/11/14 I. Hrivnacova
- Finalized modifications in previous tag (01):
  - Removed G4UI_USE/G4VIS_USE tests and init.mac macro (not needed)
  - Moved G4UIExecutive at the beginning of main() in all examples
  - Perform run initialization in macros instead of main()

04/11/14 L. Garnier (exampleB3-V10-00-01)
- Remove old G4UI_USE/G4VIS_USE
- Move G4UIExecutive at the beginning of main() 

29/10/13 I. Hrivnacova (exampleB3-V09-06-06)
- Removed SetNumberOfThreads(4) from main (use Geant4 default)
- Updated README
     
09/09/13 M.Asai (exampleB3-V09-06-05)
- B3PrimaryGeneratorAction.cc : Change G4ParticleTable::GetIon() to
  G4IonTable::GetIon(), as the former method becomes obsolete.

13/06/13 mma (exampleB3-V09-06-04)
 Fixes for MT:
- Set sensitive detector via SetSensitiveDetector(..)
- Get hits collection IDs in B3Run::RecordEvent (and not B3Run constructor)
- Add a test for primary generator action in B3RunAction::EndOfRunAction()
  as it does not exist on master
    
05/06/13 mma (exampleB3-V09-06-03)
- add section about ACTION INITALIZATION to README and .README
     
01/06/13 mma  (exampleB3-V09-06-02)
- Migration for MT:
  forgotten to add B3Run
     
31/05/13 mma  (exampleB3-V09-06-01)
- Migration for MT:
  Added B3ActionInitialization, B3Run
  Removed B3EventAction
  and updated actions classes accordingly.
  README files still need to be updated.
  
28/02/13 I. Hrivnacova
- When building materials with NistManager
  do not set fromIsotopes argument (which was set to false), 
  as since 9.6 all materials have to be built from isotopes.
  Thanks to V. Ivantchenko for pointing at this.

21/11/11 I. Hrivnacova 
- Improved vis.mac
- Removed alternative detector construction class  

14/11/11 I. Hrivnacova
- The first tagged version of the new B3 example
  (tagged in basic).

11-11-11 (mma)     
- EventAction: printModulo 10000
     
01-11-11 (mma)     
- DetectorConstruction2: - add an offset when replicate dPhi
			     
29-09-11 (mma)     
- DetectorConstruction: - replace crystal shape Trd by Box
                        - add a gap for wrapping
    
27-06-11 michel maire     
- Created.
