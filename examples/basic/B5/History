     ----------------------------------------------------------

14 April 2017  Ivana Hrivnacova Cosmo (exampleB5-V10-03-01)
- Use std::array for related data members in B5EventAction to reduce the code
- Added data members for histogram Ids and the code to retrieve them by histogram
  names via G4AnalysisManager
- Corrected the list of 2D histograms in README  

24 March 2017  Gabriele Cosmo (exampleB5-V10-03-00)
- Do not use G4AutoDelete utility for thread-local magnetic-field and
  its manager, since not necessary as not automatically deleted by the kernel.

- Fix in gui.mac by Helmut Burkhard:
  Replace undefined /globalField/setValue by  /B5/field/value
- Updated B5ActionInitialization (Ivana)  
  Event action is instantiated also on master - needed for ntuple merging
  (as its deta define the vectors refernced from ntuple)

10 March 2016 Alberto Ribon (exampleB5-V10-02-00)
- Fixed wrong determination of the copy number in replicas
  (thanks to Anna Zaborowska for reporting the problem).

  and example of this analysis use case.

  G4WTN >

06 November 2014 Ivana Hrivnacova

15 July 2014 Andrea Dotti (exampleB5-V10-00-00)

- Fix EM part of the physics list to use the new 
  processes introduced at 6.0.
- Reference output is updated accordingly.

 1st December 2003 Joseph Perl

  automatically.

15th October 2003 Mark Donszelmann
- Updated README.JAIDA to refer to the proper versions of JAIDA and AIDAJNI.
  Also changed compilation instructions to use aida-config.
- Made sure G4HadronPhysics is compiled without optmization on Darwin-g++,
  Darwin-g++2 and Darwin-g++3 (MacOS X).

14th October 2003 Mark Donszelmann
- Added clear statement to GNUmakefile that G4HadronPhysics is compiled
  without optimization.
- Made sure G4HadronPhysics is compiled without optimization on Linux-g++,
  Linux-g++2 and Linux-g++3.

14th October 2003 Joseph Perl
- Remove SetForceWireFrame(false) from three hit classes since these
  are redundant to the SetForceSolid(true) statements already there.

14th October 2003 Joseph Perl
- Remove SetForceWireFrame(true) statements from B5DetectorConstruction.cc.
  The user can instead control this at runtime using /vis/viewer/set/style

13th October 2003 Mark Donszelmann
- Re-included B5EventActionMessenger in general (non G4ANALYSIS_USE) compilation
  for use with B5EventACtion, see comment below.
- Removed all include/AIDA include files and changed the GNUmakefile. 
  To compile/link with G4ANALYSIS_USE you will need an AIDA 3.0 compliant 
  implementation, such as AIDAJNI. The makefile will execute aida-config
  to find the include files and the libraries to link with.
- setup-analysis.csh/sh/win32 now only sets up G4 specific flags to compile
  in the AIDA analysis framework.
  
13th October 2003 Joseph Perl
- Minor changes to README's sections on vis and analysis.

12th October 2003 Makoto Asai
- Move G4ANALYSIS_USE ifdef blocks so that event summary is printed out
  regardless of this flag. Only the AIDA part in B5EventAction is 
  blocked.

12th October 2003 Joseph Perl
- Modify G4TrackingAction to use G4Trajectory rather than B5Trajectory.
  This allows trajectories to pick up physics attributes.
  Left B5Trajectory in place as alternative to get color coding by
  particle type, but no physics attributes.
  Will later come up with a good scheme to make choice of one or the other
  or both of these choices at run time.
- Renamed visualization macro heprep.mac to vis.mac

20th August 2003 Mark Donszelmann
- Updated code to run with AIDAJNI 3.0.3 release, which adds compilation
  under g++ 3.2.
- Added aida.mac example file.

14th August 2003 Mark Donszelmann
- Code will only compile AIDA parts if G4ANALYSIS_USE is set.

11th July 2003 Mark Donszelmann
- Fixed all warnings under g++ 2.95.3.

3rd April 2003 Mark Donszelmann (examples-analysis-B5-V05-00-00)
- Added 2 more histograms to the example
- Fixed NullPointerException by letting SDManager delete the detectors created in
  DetectorConstruction.cc
- Added comment when quitting Geant4 that JAS window still needs closing.

26th November 2002 Mark Donszelmann
- Fixed DrifChamberHit to have a reasonable screensize (2) rather than 0.1
- Fixed minimum value for EmCalHit color to be visible (0.4).

14th November 2002 Mark Donszelmann
- Added B5 example to repository
