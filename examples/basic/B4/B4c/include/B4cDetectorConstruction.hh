/// Detector construction class to define materials and geometry.
/// The calorimeter is a box made of a given number of layers. A layer consists
/// of an absorber plate and of a detection gap. The layer is replicated.
///
/// Four parameters define the geometry of the calorimeter :
///
/// - the thickness of an absorber plate,
/// - the thickness of a gap,
/// - the number of layers,
/// - the transverse size of the calorimeter (the input face is a square).
///
/// In ConstructSDandField() sensitive detectors of B4cCalorimeterSD type
/// are created and associated with the Absorber and Gap volumes.
/// In addition a transverse uniform magnetic field is defined 
/// via G4GlobalMagFieldMessenger class.
