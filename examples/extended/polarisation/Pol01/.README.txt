 How to compute and plot the QED processes including
 polarization.
 Two possible scenarios are available:
 - Polarization transfer of an incoming beam to final state particles 
 - Material dependent transmission of a polarized beams.
 The method is explained below : see item Physics. 
	
\section Pol01_s1 GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
 The geometry consists of a single block of a homogeneous material,
 placed in a world.

 Three parameters define the geometry :
 - the material of the box,
 - the thickness of the box (sizeZ),
 - the  transverse dimension of the box (sizeXY).

 The default geometry (5mm of Iron, G4_Fe) is constructed in 
 DetectorConstruction, but the above parameters can be changed 
 interactively via the commands defined in DetectorMessenger.
 Its polarization can be accessed via the G4PolarizationMessenger
 (see example macro file), and is given in the global coordinate 
 system. 
 	
\section Pol01_s2 PHYSICS LIST
 
 The Physics List contains QED particle definitions (electrons,
 positrons and photons) and a general transportation process.
 In addition the user can add one of the two process modules:
  - 1. "standard"  - standard (unpolarized) EM physics
  - 2. "polarized" - polarized EM physics 
  
 These physics list contain the standard electromagnetic processes.
 	 
\section Pol01_s3 AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
 The primary kinematic consists of a single particle starting
 at the edge of the box. The type of the particle and its
 energy are set in PrimaryGeneratorAction (10 MeV electron).
 By default the G4ParticleGun polarization is zero.
 All parameter can be changed via the G4 build-in commands of
 ParticleGun class (see the macros provided with this example). 
 	
\section Pol01_s4 PHYSICS
 
 This example uses the following physics processes:
   - electromagnetic:
     -  photo-electric effect
     -  Compton scattering
     -  pair production
     -  bremsstrahlung
     -  ionization
     -  multiple scattering
     -  annihilation
     
   or
   - polarized electromagnetic:
     (incl. simulation of polarization transfer, and
      asymmetries for longitudinally polarized leptons, and
      circularly polarized photons) 
       - polarized photo-electric effect
       - polarized Compton scattering
       - polarized pair production
       - polarized bremsstrahlung
       - polarized ionization
       - multiple scattering
       - polarized annihilation
       
   and
   - transportation

 and defines the following particles:
 
   electron, positron, photon 


\section Pol01_s5 HISTOGRAMS
         
 The test contains 12 built-in 1D histograms, which are managed by the
 HistoManager class and its messenger, HistoMessenger. The histos can be individually 
 activated with the command :
\verbatim
/testem/histo/setHisto id nbBins  valMin valMax unit 
\endverbatim
 where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, etc..)
 (see the macro histos.mac).

  -  1  gamma energy
  -  2  gamma cos(theta)
  -  3  gamma phi
  -  4  gamma polarization
  -  5  electron energy
  -  6  electron cos(theta)
  -  7  electron phi
  -  8  electron polarization
  -  9  positron energy
  - 10 positron cos(theta)
  - 11 positron phi
  - 12 positron polarization

 If AIDA is available, i.e. if G4ANALYSIS_USE is set, these
 histograms are stored in a compressed XML file
 (Pol01.aida). These results can be displayed using a small
 program (plotResults.java) based on JAIDA by simply calling 

\verbatim
% gmake plots
\endverbatim
 	 				
\section Pol01_s6 VISUALIZATION
 
 Simulated events can be displayed on top of a representation of 
 the geometry, see vis.mac for an example.
	
\section Pol01_s7- HOW TO START ?
 
 - Execute Pol01 in 'batch' mode from the default macro file :
\verbatim
% Pol01   pol01.in
\endverbatim

 - Execute Pol01 in 'batch' mode including aida output :
\verbatim
% Pol01   histos.mac
\endverbatim

 - If available use JAIDA to display the results via
\verbatim
% gmake plots
\endverbatim

 - A visualisation example is available by calling 
\verbatim
% Pol01  
[...]
PreInit> /control/execute vis.mac
\endverbatim
