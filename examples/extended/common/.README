/*! \page Examples_common Category "common"

  In order to reduce code duplication and to reduce the number of variants of 
  the code of same kind, we define a set of common classes which
  can be reused in "feature" examples demonstrating just a particular feature.
  This module is going to be enhanced in future. Currently it provides 
  the following sets of classes:

  - \ref extended_common_analysis :
    - ExG4HbookAnalysisManager - the analysis manager class for HBOOK
      As this class requires CERNLIB libraries, its compilation
      is optional. To build it, the following environment variables
      must be defined:
\verbatim      
G4_USE_HBOOK = 1
CERNLIB = path to the CERNLIB installation
\endverbatim
  
  - \ref extended_common_detectorConstruction :
    - two simple detector construction classes with a messenger
  
  - \ref extended_common_physicsList :
    - ExG4PhysicsList00 - physics list with geantino and chargedgeantino only
  
  - \ref extended_common_primaryGenerator :
    - two simple primary generator classes (with G4ParticleGun and
      G4ParticleGeneralSource)
  
  - \ref extended_common_userActions :
    - event action and run action classes with messengers
