        Geant4 extended examples - exotic physics
        ----------------------------------------------

 Examples in this directory demonstrate exotic physics applications. 
 Currently, four examples are provided:

channeling
----------

This example simulates channeling of 400 GeV/c protons in a bent crystal.

dmparticle
---------
This is very preliminary and simplified Geant4 example for light dark matter 
(LDM) particles. 

monopole
---------

This example is devoted to the energy deposited by classical magnetic
monopole.

phonon
------

This example simulates phonons in sub-Kelvin temperature Germanium crystal.

ucn
---

This example simulates the passage of ultra-cold neutrons (UCN) in a
hollow pipe.
