This example is devoted to the energy deposited by classical magnetic
monopole.



 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION

     The geometry consists of a single block of a homogenous material,
     placed in a world.

     Four parameters define the geometry :
 	- the material of the box 
	- the thickness of the box 
	- the tranverse dimension of the box 
	- the maximal step size in target

     The default is 10 cm of alumunium, step is limited by 5mm.
     Equivalent UI commands are following:
        /testex/det/setMat G4_Al
        /testex/det/sizeX  10 cm
        /testex/det/sizeYZ 5 cm
        /testex/det/setStepSize 5 mm

     The default geometry is constructed in DetectorConstruction class,
     but all of the above parameters can be changed interactively via
     the commands defined in the DetectorMessenger class. After changing
     material and/or dimentions one must update the detector construction:
        /testex/det/update

 2- PHYSICS LIST

    Physics Lists include standard QGSP physics and additional builder
		for monopole physics.
    To define monopole parameters an extra string should be provided
      a) interactive mode by UI command:
         /monopole/setup 2 0 200 GeV (magnetic number, electric number, mass)
      b) batch mode:
         $G4BIN/$G4SYSTEM/monopole file.mac '2 0 200 GeV'  

 3- AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR

     The primary kinematic consists of a single particle which hits the
     block perpendicular to the input face. The type of the particle
     and its energy are set in the PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can
     changed via the G4 build-in commands of ParticleGun class (see
     the macros provided with this example).
     The default is monopole 100 GeV

     In addition one can define randomly the impact point of the incident
     particle. The corresponding interactive command is built in
     PrimaryGeneratorMessenger class.

     A RUN is a set of events.


 4- VISUALIZATION

     The Visualization Manager is set in the main() for interactive session.
     The initialisation of the drawing is done via the command
       /control/execute vis.mac

     The detector has a default view which is a longitudinal view of the box.
     
     The tracks are drawn at the end of event, and erased at the end of run.


 5- HOW TO START ?

     - execute Test  in 'batch' mode from macro files
 	% monopole  monopole.in

     - execute Test  in 'interactive mode' with visualization
 	% monopole
 		....
 	Idle> type your commands
 		....
 	Idle> exit


 6- HISTOGRAMS

     The result is five histograms:
				- Monopole eneregy deposition in current material
				- dedx for proton
				- dedx for monopole
				- range for proton in current material
				- range for monopole in current material

     The histogram is saved in hbook (default monopole.hbook, but can be changed
		 using    testex/run/HistoName   and    testex/run/HistoType   comands)
		 Limit of bin size can be set with testex/run/binSize (default 5mm). Real size
		 is chosen as a minimal between this and step limit (see Geometry section)

     Note that, by default, histograms are disabled. To activate them, uncomment
     G4ANALYSIS_USE in GNUmakefile.

 7- Using histograms
 ------------------- 

     By default the histograms are not activated. To activate histograms
     the environment variable G4ANALYSIS_USE should be defined. For instance
     uncomment the flag G4ANALYSIS_USE in GNUmakefile.

     To use histograms any of implementations of AIDA interfaces should
     be available (see http://aida.freehep.org).

     A package including AIDA and extended interfaces also using Python
     is PI, available from: http://cern.ch/pi .

     Once installed PI or PI-Lite in a specified local area $MYPY, it is
     required to add the installation path to $PATH, i.e. for example,
     for release 1.2.1 of PI:

     setenv PATH ${PATH}:$MYPI/1.2.1/app/releases/PI/PI_1_2_1/rh73_gcc32/bin

     CERN users can use the PATH to the LCG area on AFS.

     Before compilation of the example it is optimal to clean up old files:

     gmake histclean
     gmake

     Before running the example the command should be issued:

     eval `aida-config --runtime csh`
