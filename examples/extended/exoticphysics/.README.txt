/*! \page Examples_exoticphysics Category "exoticphysics"

 Examples in this directory demonstrate exotic physics applications. 
 Currently, four examples are provided:

\link Examplechanneling channeling \endlink

 Channeling examples are dedicated to various coherent effects
 in oriented crystals, in particular, channeling, channeling radiation,
 coherent bremsstrahlung, coherent pair production etc. as well as their
 various applications.

\link Exampledmparticle dmparticle \endlink

This is very preliminary and simplified Geant4 example for light dark matter 
(LDM) particles. 

\link Examplemonopole monopole \endlink

This example is devoted to the energy deposited by classical magnetic
monopole.

\link Examplephonon phonon \endlink

This example simulates phonons in sub-Kelvin temperature Germanium crystal.

\link Examplesaxs saxs \endlink

The example saxs implements the typical setup of a Small Angle X-ray
Scattering (SAXS) experiment.

\link Exampleucn ucn \endlink

This example simulates the passage of ultra-cold neutrons (UCN) in a
hollow pipe.
