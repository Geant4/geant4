                    Phonon Example History file
                    -----------------------------
This file should be used by the G4 example coordinator to briefly
summarize all major modifications introduced in the code and keep
track of all tags.

14 October 2016 G.Folger
- remove direct use of {a,the}ParticleIterator, use GetParticleTableIterator().
  fix required by clang39 on Linux and MAC

19 August 2015: M. Kelsey   (phononExample-V10-01-01)
- XAluminumElectrodeHit.hh:  Make simple container with public data members
- XAluminumElectrodeSensitivity:  Improve MT robustness, make HC local, make
  file streams shared-static, with protective mutexes.

NOTE:  MT output from clang, icc is different from gcc.  Change below means
       test jobs still failing on those compilers.

13 August 2015: G. Folger   (phononExample-V10-01-00)
- Update caustic.out-MT to file created on slc6, gcc49, MT

12 October 2014:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V10-00-03)
- caustic.out-MT-*, timing.out-MT-*:  Remove platform-specific reference files.
- caustic.out-MT, timing.out-MT:  Add new references for MT jobs; output is
  different than sequential build.
- CTestDefinitions.txt:  Use new platform-independent MT reference files.

08 October 2014:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V10-00-02)
- XAluminumElectrodeHit:  G4Allocator must be thread local.

06 October 2014:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V10-00-01)
Migration for MT compatibility:
- XGeBox.cc:  Add XActionInitialization, use of G4MTRunManager.
- XActionInitialization:  Move generator and stacking action here.
- XGeneratorConstruction:  Move SD instantiation to new function.
- sources.cmake:  Add new XActionInitialization.hh,cc

06 February 2014:  J. Allison (phononExample-V10-00-00)
- CMakeLists.txt: Added CrystalMaps to list copied to build directory.

18 November 2013:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V09-06-09)
- XDetectorConstruction.cc:  Remove verbosity settings.
- XPhysicsList:  Add verbosity ctor argument, use to set process vebosities.
- run.out:  Updated content to reflect new verbosity controls
- caustic.out-MT-Darwin, timing.out-MT-Darwin: New reference files from CDash.
- caustic.out-MT-Linux, timing.out-MT-Linux: New reference files from CDash.

14 November 2013:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V09-06-08)
- XDetectorConstruction.cc:  *TEMPORARY* Remove lattice dump, keep LM
  verbosity, add lattice verbosity.  Requires materials-V09-06-29.

NOTE:  XPhysicsList.cc still has process verbosity.

13 November 2013:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V09-06-07)
- XDetectorConstruction.cc:  *TEMPORARY* Turn on LatticeManager verbosity
  and dump generated lattice to output.  Requires materials-V09-06-28.

12 November 2013:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V09-06-06)
- run.in:  Remove temporary tracking verbosity.  Windows jobs crash in the
  very first track.

- XPhysicsList.cc:  *TEMPORARY*  Set verbosity on phonon processes.

9 November 2013:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V09-06-05)
- CTestDefinitions.txt:  Fix variable setting for comparing timing.out on MT
  jobs (_causticRef was set twice).

- run.in:  *TEMPORARY* Add tracking verbosity to get output useful for
  diagnosing a runtime problem on win7-vc11.  This will be removed later.

7 November 2013:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V09-06-04)
- REMOVED particles, lattice classes, and processes.  Now all in GEANT4
  toolkit for Release 10.  Eliminated use of G4VUserTrackInfo, creating a
  singleton (thread-local) map between tracks and wavevectors, for use by
  the stacking action and by processes (the map is also in the toolkit).

	XLPhonon	-> source/particles/*/G4PhononLong
	XTPhononFast	-> source/particles/*/G4PhononTransFast
	XTPhononSlow	-> source/particles/*/G4PhononTransSlow

	XLogicalLattice	-> source/materials/*/G4LatticeLogical
	XPhysicalLattice-> source/materials/*/G4LatticePhysical

	XLatticeManager3-> source/processes/phonon/*/G4LatticeManager
	XPhononDownconversionProcess
			-> source/processes/phonon/*/G4PhononDownconversion
	XPhononReflectionProcess
			-> source/processes/phonon/*/G4PhononReflection
	XPhononScatteringProcess
			-> source/processes/phonon/*/G4PhononScattering

	XPhononTrackInformation	-> DELETED

- Renaming of classes, objects, and member functions in above code affected
  several other classes.  Also cleaned up #includes in both .hh and .cc files:

	XDetectorConstruction.hh,.cc
	XPhysicsList.cc
	XPhononStackingAction.cc
	XPrimaryGeneratorAction.cc

- Internal "CRYSTALMAPS" envvar replaced with "G4LATTICEDATA" used in
  source/processes/phonon/*/G4LatticeReader.

	CrystalMaps/Ge/ subdirectory added with config file for numerical
	constants.  Lookup tables moved into subdirectory.

- Updated caustic.out, timing.out to reflect minor numerical differences due
  to use of h_Planck.  Updated run.out to reflect reduced message output.

13 June 2013: A. Dotti (phononExample-V09-06-03)
- Adding reference files for MT mode, adding CTestDefinitions.txt 
  file containing new ctest with OS/Mode reference files

6 June 2013: G. Cosmo (phononExample-V09-06-02)
- Fixed printout in XLogicalLattice.cc.

19 February 2013: I. Hrivnacova (phononExample-V09-06-01)
- Applied coding guidelines (separators)

13 February 2013: I. Hrivnacova (phononExample-V09-06-00)
- Applied coding guidelines (data members names, virtual keyword)

28 November 2012: G. Cosmo (phononExample-V09-05-09)
- Fixed cases of variable shadowing.

15 November 2012: I. Hrivnacova (phononExample-V09-05-08)
- Fixed files descriptions, .README for a change in the example 
  directory name.

14 November 2012: I. Hrivnacova (phononExample-V09-05-07)
- Added copying macros in build area in CMake build
- Updated .README with recent changes in README

13 November 2012: P Mato (phononExample-V09-05-06)
- Added property svn:eol-style native to caustic.out and timing.out files

12 November 2012: P Mato (phononExample-V09-05-05)
- Removed open mode fstream::in for output files. This will make
  the associated test not to fail on Windows(VC9).

1 November 2012: D. Brandt (phononExample-V09-05-04)
- Renamed directory from phononExample to phonon, per Gabriele Cosmo.

1 November 2012: D. Brandt (phononExample-V09-05-03)
- XPhononReflectionProcess.cc: Fix uninitialized variable.

30 October 2012: D. Brandt (phononExample-V09-05-02)
- XAlminumElectrodeSensitivity constructor now checks for existence
  of output files. If files exist, output is appended, if not they
  are created
- Path for crystal map files is now taken from CRYSTALMAPS
  environment variable
- Added inline comments

29 October 2012: I. Hrivnacova (phononExample-V09-05-01)
- Added explicit include of units and physical constants
- Replaced own defined PI with pi from physical constants
- Adding Copyright where missing
- Allocate XLogicalLattice on heap to avoid a stack overflow 
- Added file descriptions (for Doxygen documentation)
- Added .README file
- Replaced tabulations with space characters

26 October 2012: M.Asai (phononExample-V09-05-00)
- Introducing a new example.
