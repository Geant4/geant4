     changed caused by new CLHEP 2.4.0.4 with changes in random


4 December 2017 G.Folger     (phononExample-V10-03-08)
- fix typo in caustic.out-clang-MT, it had extra \n at end.

24 November 2017 G.Folger    (phononExample-V10-03-07)
-  update references for caustic and timing
     changed caused by new CLHEP 2.4.0.0 random number generator

24 October 2017 G.Folger    (phononExample-V10-03-06)
-  create caustic and timings with \n at least line, drop first
     empty line; it is difficult to create file without final \nl
-  update references for this change.

24 October 2017 G.Folger    (phononExample-V10-03-05)
-  update references for caustic and timing
     caused by change in G4RandomDirection, tag global-V10-03-11

25 January 2017 G.Folger    (phononExample-V10-03-04)
-  correct new timing.out-MT: remove last newline from file

25 January 2017 G.Folger    (phononExample-V10-03-03)
-  Update timing.out-MT

24 January 2017 Ben Morgan (phononExample-V10-03-02)
- CTestDefinitions.txt: Use non-dereference form of variable expansion
  to resolve CMP0054 related warnings on Windows platforms where
  the compiler ID variable (MSVC) is also the name of a cmake
  variable.

19 January 2017 Ben Morgan (phononExample-V10-03-01)
- ComparePhonon.cmake: New script to perform comparison of
  timing and caustic output/reference files. When comparison
  fails, prints contents of files to screen, hence running
  comparison in script.
- CTestDefinitions.txt: Migrate comparison tests to use new
  ComparePhonon.cmake script.

18 January 2017 Ben Morgan (phononExample-V10-03-00)
- Split build/run/compare test into three: build and run,
  compare timing outputs, compare caustic outputs.
  Needed due to use of multiple POSTCMD calls, when
  geant4_add_test only supports one.

19 November 2016 A.Dotti     (phononExample-V10-02-08)
- explicit set of SD to manager

14 October 2016 G.Folger    (phononExample-V10-02-07)

-  2nd attempt to fix typo

29 July 2016: Gunter Folger (phononExample-V10-02-05)
-  fix typo

29 July 2016: Gunter Folger (phononExample-V10-02-04)
-  correct selection of caustic reference on MAC in MT mode;
   on MAC, compiler id is AppleClang.

26 July 2016: Gunter Folger (phononExample-V10-02-03)
- run.in: do not set random seed, this changes caustic.ssv and timing.ssv

26 July 2016: Gunter Folger (phononExample-V10-02-02)

17 February 2016: E. Bagli (phononExample-V10-02-01)
- run.in: set the random seed in the macro file

19 August 2015: M. Kelsey   (phononExample-V10-01-01)
- XAluminumElectrodeHit.hh:  Make simple container with public data members
- XAluminumElectrodeSensitivity:  Improve MT robustness, make HC local, make
  file streams shared-static, with protective mutexes.

NOTE:  MT output from clang, icc is different from gcc.  Change below means
       test jobs still failing on those compilers.

13 August 2015: G. Folger   (phononExample-V10-01-00)
- Update caustic.out-MT to file created on slc6, gcc49, MT

12 October 2014:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V10-00-03)
- caustic.out-MT-*, timing.out-MT-*:  Remove platform-specific reference files.
- caustic.out-MT, timing.out-MT:  Add new references for MT jobs; output is
  different than sequential build.
- CTestDefinitions.txt:  Use new platform-independent MT reference files.

08 October 2014:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V10-00-02)
- XAluminumElectrodeHit:  G4Allocator must be thread local.

06 October 2014:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V10-00-01)
Migration for MT compatibility:
- XGeBox.cc:  Add XActionInitialization, use of G4MTRunManager.
- XActionInitialization:  Move generator and stacking action here.
- XGeneratorConstruction:  Move SD instantiation to new function.
- sources.cmake:  Add new XActionInitialization.hh,cc

06 February 2014:  J. Allison (phononExample-V10-00-00)
- CMakeLists.txt: Added CrystalMaps to list copied to build directory.

18 November 2013:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V09-06-09)
- XDetectorConstruction.cc:  Remove verbosity settings.
- XPhysicsList:  Add verbosity ctor argument, use to set process vebosities.

- caustic.out-MT-Darwin, timing.out-MT-Darwin: New reference files from CDash.
- caustic.out-MT-Linux, timing.out-MT-Linux: New reference files from CDash.

14 November 2013:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V09-06-08)
- XDetectorConstruction.cc:  *TEMPORARY* Remove lattice dump, keep LM
  verbosity, add lattice verbosity.  Requires materials-V09-06-29.

NOTE:  XPhysicsList.cc still has process verbosity.

13 November 2013:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V09-06-07)
- XDetectorConstruction.cc:  *TEMPORARY* Turn on LatticeManager verbosity
  and dump generated lattice to output.  Requires materials-V09-06-28.

12 November 2013:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V09-06-06)
- run.in:  Remove temporary tracking verbosity.  Windows jobs crash in the
  very first track.

- XPhysicsList.cc:  *TEMPORARY*  Set verbosity on phonon processes.

9 November 2013:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V09-06-05)
- CTestDefinitions.txt:  Fix variable setting for comparing timing.out on MT
  jobs (_causticRef was set twice).

- run.in:  *TEMPORARY* Add tracking verbosity to get output useful for
  diagnosing a runtime problem on win7-vc11.  This will be removed later.

7 November 2013:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V09-06-04)
- REMOVED particles, lattice classes, and processes.  Now all in GEANT4
  toolkit for Release 10.  Eliminated use of G4VUserTrackInfo, creating a
  singleton (thread-local) map between tracks and wavevectors, for use by
  the stacking action and by processes (the map is also in the toolkit).

	XLPhonon	-> source/particles/*/G4PhononLong
	XTPhononFast	-> source/particles/*/G4PhononTransFast
	XTPhononSlow	-> source/particles/*/G4PhononTransSlow

	XLogicalLattice	-> source/materials/*/G4LatticeLogical
	XPhysicalLattice-> source/materials/*/G4LatticePhysical

	XLatticeManager3-> source/processes/phonon/*/G4LatticeManager
	XPhononDownconversionProcess
			-> source/processes/phonon/*/G4PhononDownconversion
	XPhononReflectionProcess
			-> source/processes/phonon/*/G4PhononReflection
	XPhononScatteringProcess
			-> source/processes/phonon/*/G4PhononScattering

	XPhononTrackInformation	-> DELETED

- Renaming of classes, objects, and member functions in above code affected
  several other classes.  Also cleaned up #includes in both .hh and .cc files:

	XDetectorConstruction.hh,.cc
	XPhysicsList.cc
	XPhononStackingAction.cc
	XPrimaryGeneratorAction.cc

- Internal "CRYSTALMAPS" envvar replaced with "G4LATTICEDATA" used in
  source/processes/phonon/*/G4LatticeReader.

	CrystalMaps/Ge/ subdirectory added with config file for numerical
	constants.  Lookup tables moved into subdirectory.

- Updated caustic.out, timing.out to reflect minor numerical differences due
  to use of h_Planck.  Updated run.out to reflect reduced message output.

13 June 2013: A. Dotti (phononExample-V09-06-03)

  the associated test not to fail on Windows(VC9).

1 November 2012: D. Brandt (phononExample-V09-05-04)
- Renamed directory from phononExample to phonon, per Gabriele Cosmo.

30 October 2012: D. Brandt (phononExample-V09-05-02)

  environment variable
