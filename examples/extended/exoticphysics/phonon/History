This file should be used by the G4 example coordinator to briefly
summarize all major modifications introduced in the code and keep
track of all tags.

25 January 2017 G.Folger    (phononExample-V10-03-04)
-  correct new timing.out-MT: remove last newline from file

25 January 2017 G.Folger    (phononExample-V10-03-03)
-  Update timing.out-MT

24 January 2017 Ben Morgan (phononExample-V10-03-02)
- CTestDefinitions.txt: Use non-dereference form of variable expansion
  to resolve CMP0054 related warnings on Windows platforms where
  the compiler ID variable (MSVC) is also the name of a cmake
  variable.

19 January 2017 Ben Morgan (phononExample-V10-03-01)
- ComparePhonon.cmake: New script to perform comparison of
  timing and caustic output/reference files. When comparison
  fails, prints contents of files to screen, hence running
  comparison in script.
- CTestDefinitions.txt: Migrate comparison tests to use new
  ComparePhonon.cmake script.

18 January 2017 Ben Morgan (phononExample-V10-03-00)
- Split build/run/compare test into three: build and run,
  compare timing outputs, compare caustic outputs.
  Needed due to use of multiple POSTCMD calls, when
  geant4_add_test only supports one.

19 November 2016 A.Dotti     (phononExample-V10-02-08)
- explicit set of SD to manager
 
14 October 2016 G.Folger    (phononExample-V10-02-07)
- remove direct use of {a,the}ParticleIterator, use GetParticleTableIterator().
    fix required by clang39 on Linux and MAC

29 July 2016: Gunter Folger (phononExample-V10-02-06)
-  2nd attempt to fix typo

29 July 2016: Gunter Folger (phononExample-V10-02-05)
-  fix typo

29 July 2016: Gunter Folger (phononExample-V10-02-04)
-  correct selection of caustic reference on MAC in MT mode;
   on MAC, compiler id is AppleClang.

26 July 2016: Gunter Folger (phononExample-V10-02-03)
- run.in: do not set random seed, this changes caustic.ssv and timing.ssv

26 July 2016: Gunter Folger (phononExample-V10-02-02)
- add clang/icc specific references, and switch depending on compiler 

17 February 2016: E. Bagli (phononExample-V10-02-01)
- run.in: set the random seed in the macro file

19 August 2015: M. Kelsey   (phononExample-V10-01-01)
- XAluminumElectrodeHit.hh:  Make simple container with public data members
- XAluminumElectrodeSensitivity:  Improve MT robustness, make HC local, make
  file streams shared-static, with protective mutexes.

NOTE:  MT output from clang, icc is different from gcc.  Change below means
       test jobs still failing on those compilers.

13 August 2015: G. Folger   (phononExample-V10-01-00)
- Update caustic.out-MT to file created on slc6, gcc49, MT

12 October 2014:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V10-00-03)
- caustic.out-MT-*, timing.out-MT-*:  Remove platform-specific reference files.
- caustic.out-MT, timing.out-MT:  Add new references for MT jobs; output is
  different than sequential build.
- CTestDefinitions.txt:  Use new platform-independent MT reference files.

08 October 2014:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V10-00-02)
- XAluminumElectrodeHit:  G4Allocator must be thread local.

06 October 2014:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V10-00-01)
Migration for MT compatibility:
- XGeBox.cc:  Add XActionInitialization, use of G4MTRunManager.
- XActionInitialization:  Move generator and stacking action here.
- XGeneratorConstruction:  Move SD instantiation to new function.
- sources.cmake:  Add new XActionInitialization.hh,cc

06 February 2014:  J. Allison (phononExample-V10-00-00)
- CMakeLists.txt: Added CrystalMaps to list copied to build directory.

18 November 2013:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V09-06-09)
- XDetectorConstruction.cc:  Remove verbosity settings.
- XPhysicsList:  Add verbosity ctor argument, use to set process vebosities.
- run.out:  Updated content to reflect new verbosity controls
- caustic.out-MT-Darwin, timing.out-MT-Darwin: New reference files from CDash.
- caustic.out-MT-Linux, timing.out-MT-Linux: New reference files from CDash.

14 November 2013:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V09-06-08)
- XDetectorConstruction.cc:  *TEMPORARY* Remove lattice dump, keep LM
  verbosity, add lattice verbosity.  Requires materials-V09-06-29.

NOTE:  XPhysicsList.cc still has process verbosity.

13 November 2013:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V09-06-07)
- XDetectorConstruction.cc:  *TEMPORARY* Turn on LatticeManager verbosity
  and dump generated lattice to output.  Requires materials-V09-06-28.

12 November 2013:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V09-06-06)
- run.in:  Remove temporary tracking verbosity.  Windows jobs crash in the
  very first track.

- XPhysicsList.cc:  *TEMPORARY*  Set verbosity on phonon processes.

9 November 2013:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V09-06-05)
- CTestDefinitions.txt:  Fix variable setting for comparing timing.out on MT
  jobs (_causticRef was set twice).

- run.in:  *TEMPORARY* Add tracking verbosity to get output useful for
  diagnosing a runtime problem on win7-vc11.  This will be removed later.

7 November 2013:  M. Kelsey (phononExample-V09-06-04)
- REMOVED particles, lattice classes, and processes.  Now all in GEANT4
  toolkit for Release 10.  Eliminated use of G4VUserTrackInfo, creating a
  singleton (thread-local) map between tracks and wavevectors, for use by
  the stacking action and by processes (the map is also in the toolkit).

	XLPhonon	-> source/particles/*/G4PhononLong
	XTPhononFast	-> source/particles/*/G4PhononTransFast
	XTPhononSlow	-> source/particles/*/G4PhononTransSlow

	XLogicalLattice	-> source/materials/*/G4LatticeLogical
	XPhysicalLattice-> source/materials/*/G4LatticePhysical

	XLatticeManager3-> source/processes/phonon/*/G4LatticeManager
	XPhononDownconversionProcess
			-> source/processes/phonon/*/G4PhononDownconversion
	XPhononReflectionProcess
			-> source/processes/phonon/*/G4PhononReflection
	XPhononScatteringProcess
			-> source/processes/phonon/*/G4PhononScattering

	XPhononTrackInformation	-> DELETED

- Renaming of classes, objects, and member functions in above code affected
  several other classes.  Also cleaned up #includes in both .hh and .cc files:

	XDetectorConstruction.hh,.cc
	XPhysicsList.cc
	XPhononStackingAction.cc
	XPrimaryGeneratorAction.cc

- Internal "CRYSTALMAPS" envvar replaced with "G4LATTICEDATA" used in
  source/processes/phonon/*/G4LatticeReader.

	CrystalMaps/Ge/ subdirectory added with config file for numerical
	constants.  Lookup tables moved into subdirectory.

- Updated caustic.out, timing.out to reflect minor numerical differences due
  to use of h_Planck.  Updated run.out to reflect reduced message output.

13 June 2013: A. Dotti (phononExample-V09-06-03)
- Adding reference files for MT mode, adding CTestDefinitions.txt 
  file containing new ctest with OS/Mode reference files

12 November 2012: P Mato (phononExample-V09-05-05)
- Removed open mode fstream::in for output files. This will make
  the associated test not to fail on Windows(VC9).

1 November 2012: D. Brandt (phononExample-V09-05-04)
- Renamed directory from phononExample to phonon, per Gabriele Cosmo.

1 November 2012: D. Brandt (phononExample-V09-05-03)

30 October 2012: D. Brandt (phononExample-V09-05-02)

  environment variable
- Added inline comments
