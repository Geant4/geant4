 Examples in this directory demonstrate exotic physics applications. 
 Currently, four examples are provided:

\ref Examples_channeling

 Channeling examples are dedicated to various coherent effects
 in oriented crystals, in particular, channeling, channeling radiation,
 coherent bremsstrahlung, coherent pair production etc. as well as their
 various applications.

\ref Exampledmparticle

This is very preliminary and simplified Geant4 example for light dark matter 
(LDM) particles. 

\ref Examplemonopole

This example is devoted to the energy deposited by classical magnetic
monopole.

\ref Examplephonon

This example simulates phonons in sub-Kelvin temperature Germanium crystal.

\ref Examplesaxs

The example saxs implements the typical setup of a Small Angle X-ray
Scattering (SAXS) experiment.

\ref Exampleucn

This example simulates the passage of ultra-cold neutrons (UCN) in a
hollow pipe.
