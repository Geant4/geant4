\section ch3_s1 INTRODUCTION
Example ch3 demonstrates the minimum requirements necessary to integrate the
G4CoherentPairProduction process into a project, along with the G4ChannelingFastSimModel
and G4BaierKatkov models, to simulate the physics of electromagnetic showers in
an oriented crystal.

The key concept is the acceleration of electromagnetic processes (both radiation and
pair production) in an oriented crystal, which can significantly reduce the effective
radiation length [1,2]. Potential applications include electron/positron sources for
accelerator experiments, as well as crystalline oriented calorimeters for collider and
space applications [1,2].

This example serves as a guideline for users on how to add this physics
to their existing Geant4 projects. It includes the minimum necessary options
to incorporate this physics. Specifically, it requires registering
G4FastSimulationPhysics and G4CoherentPairProductionPhysics in the main routine and
adding a few lines of code in DetectorConstruction.

All of this physics does not depend on the physics list. In particular, the
process G4CoherentPairProduction simulates only coherent part of pair production in
the crystal volume, while the incoherent one should be simulated with
standard Geant4 processes.

\section ch3_s2 DESCRIPTION

The example simulates high energy photon interaction (typically above 10 GeV) with
an oriented W crystal with <111> crystal axes aligned along the photon beam direction.

The structure of this example is very similar to the example ch1.
ch3 includes a straight W crystal and a detector positioned behind it.
The incoming photon beam is set up in macro run.mac.

One can also use the Geant4 GUI by launching the code without specifying a macro file. 
In this case, the visualization setup is automatically loaded through the vis.mac and 
init_vis.mac macro files. The initial beam distribution in this setup will be identical 
to that in run.mac.

The example does not include any input of the model or geometry parameters
from the macro to keep it as straightforward as possible. The output is recorded
into the file results.root. It consists of the spectrums of e-, e+
and gamma arriving to the detector. To build these plots, one has to
open this file in root and use
\verbatim
Spectrum_electrons->Draw()
\endverbatim

\verbatim
Spectrum_positrons->Draw()
\endverbatim

and

\verbatim
Spectrum_gamma->Draw()
\endverbatim

for e-, e+ and gamma, respectively.
