                     CAD STEP interface example 
                     --------------------------

This is an example using particle tracking in STEP CAD-models through
AP203 compliant STEP descriptions. The model can be changed by invoking
the UI command "/mydet/SelectDetector <model-name>", where
<model-name> is the name of the STEP file <model-name>.stp which
describes the detector geometry.
Due to limitations of the NIST STEP reader, a correct behavior can be
assured only for non-ISO/ANSI setup of compilers (i.e. egcs-1.1.2 or old
non-ANSI compilers) as specified in the notes for the SCL-3.2 package.
Therefore, the GNUmakefile in this example has been modified to force
non-ISO/ANSI compilation on Linux platforms, to allow the code to build.
AP203 STEP files showing errors in the reading process, can be formatted
using the PERL scripts provided in the "scripts" directory; most patterns
will be corrected. If errors are still observed, please inform us so that
the scripts can be enhanced.
