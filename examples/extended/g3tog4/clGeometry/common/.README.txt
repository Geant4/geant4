/*! \page Examples_common Category "common"

  In order to reduce code duplication and to reduce the number of variants of 
  the code of same kind, we define a set of common classes which
  can be reused in "feature" examples demonstrating just a particular feature.
  This module is going to be enhanced in future. Currently it provides 
  the following sets of classes:

  - Detector construction classes
    - two simple detector construction classes with a messenger
  
  - Physics list classes
    - ExG4PhysicsList00 - physics list with geantino and chargedgeantino only
  
  - Primary generator classes
    - two simple primary generator classes (with G4ParticleGun and
      G4ParticleGeneralSource)
  
  - User action classes:
    - event action and run action classes with messengers
