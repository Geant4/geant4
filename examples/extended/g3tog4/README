                         G3toG4 tool's examples
			 ----------------------

This directory includes two applications to demonstrate the usage of the
g3tog4 tool for converting Geant 3.21 simple geometries to Geant4 ones.

clGeometry
----------
Contains the code to build a detector geometry using the call list
mechanism and also provides visualization. The name of the executable is
clGeometry.

To run the application, one must provide as input argument a call list file
(few test samples are placed in ../data), generated by the rztog4 application
which can be built typing "gmake bin" from $G4INSTALL/source/g3tog4.

clGeometry.in is a macro to be executed either interactively or in batch.

For example:
> cd $G4INSTALL/examples/extended/g3tog4
> clGeometry data/testmodel.dat clGeometry.in

cltog4
------
is a simple example which simply invokes the call list interpreter method
G4BuildGeom from G3toG4DetectorConstruction class, builds the geometry
and exits.

As for clGeometry, a call list needs to be fed to cltog4. A macro cltog4.in
is available to be executed either interactively or in batch.
