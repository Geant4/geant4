/*! \page Examplegflasha Example gflasha

This example demonstrates usage 'gflash' shower parameterisation
in homogeneous calorimeter. Compare with glash1,2,3 in this
example histograms was added. This makes it possible to use this
example for fine tuning of GFLASH parameters.

This example allows to compare the shower profiles from fast simulation
with full simulation by histograming of longitudinal (slice)
and radial profiles with different "binning".
Then GFlash fast simulation can be "tuned" via modification
of the model parameters file:

include/ExGflashHomoShowerTuning.hh

in this example.

\section gflasha_s1 Geometry Definition

In this example the calorimeter is a simple cube,
which consists of 10 x 10 crystals of PbWO4 (CMS like).

Geometry, sensitive detector and hits are defined respectively in:
- ExGflashDetectorConstruction
- ExGflashSensitiveDetector
- ExGflashHit

Materials can be choosen from Nist Materials: G4_Air G4_WATER ...
eg: 
\verbatim
/exgflash/det/setMat G4_PbWO4 
\endverbatim
see also: csi1.mac 

\section gflasha_s2 Hit Scoring

The virtual cylinder sliced longitudinally (slice) and radially (ring) was used.
The size of the slices and rings are expressed in radiation 
length units and can be changed.
eg: 
\verbatim
/exgflash/det/setLbin 20   1.    ---> 20 slices of 1. radl
/exgflash/det/setRbin  5   0.25  --->  5 rings of 0.25 radl
     (MaxBin = 500 in both directions)
\endverbatim

In ExGflashEventAction class the arrays corresponded slices and rings was
created and filled with hists information. This arrays was use to fill
histograms later.

\section gflasha_s3 Visualization

The Visualization Manager is set in the main().
The initialization of the drawing is done via the commands /vis/...
in the macro vis.mac. To get visualization:
\verbatim
/control/execute vis.mac
\endverbatim

\section gflasha_s4 How to start ?

- Execute ExGflasha in 'batch' mode from macro files
\verbatim
 % ExGflasha   test.mac
\endverbatim

- Execute ExGflasha in 'interactive mode' with visualization
\verbatim
 % ExGflasha
   ....
  Idle> type your commands
  ....
  Idle> exit
\endverbatim

The GFLASH activated via:
\verbatim
/GFlash/flag 1
\endverbatim

\section gflasha_s5 Histograms

ExGflasha produces several histograms:
The histograms defined in ExGflashHistoManager class

Content of these histo:

- h0 : energy deposit       per event
- h1 : the number of hits  per event
- h2 : the energy per hit ( in MeV )

- p0 : longitudinal energy profile
- p1 : radial energy profile

- p2 : cumulated longitudinal energy profile
- p3 : cumulated radial energy profile

To define the output file name with histograms, use the UI command :
\verbatim
/analysys/setFileName name
\endverbatim

\section gflasha_s6 Macros

The macros to run in batch mode:

- test.mac - default macro for example testing

- run01.mac - show how redefine the histograms
  
- csi1.mac - macro which produce profiles in CsI Material

- test0.mac - profile caparison, long run without GFLASH
- test1.mac - profile comprising, long run with GFLASH on
