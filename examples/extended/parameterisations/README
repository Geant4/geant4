        Geant4 extended examples - parameterisations
        ----------------------------------------------

 Examples in this directory demonstrate use of parameterisation libraries. 
 Currently, two examples are provided:

 Par01
 -------

 This example demonstrates the use of parameterisation facilities.
 It was moved in extended examples from novice/N05 with removal of
 novice examples. 

 Par02
 -------
 
 This example shows how to do "track and energy smearing" in Geant4,
 in order to have a very fast simulation based on assumed detector
