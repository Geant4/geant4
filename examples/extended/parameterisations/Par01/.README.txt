/*! \page ExamplePar01 Example Par01

Example Par01 provides examples of the use of parameterisation facilities.
It was moved in extended examples from novice/N05 with removal of
novice examples. 

Geometry, sensitive detector, hits, processes are defined respectively in:
- Par01DetectorConstruction
- Par01CalorimeterSD
- Par01CalorimeterHit

The particularities are:

- The parameterisation models:

  - Par01EMShowerModel which provides a crude
    parameterisation for e+/e-/gamma. This model
    is bound to the EM calorimeter. \n\n
    
  - Par01PionShowerModel: an even more crude
    parameterisation for pi+/pi-. This model
    is bound to a ghost volume. \n\n
    
  Those two models produces "hits": ie the energy
  of the incident particle is distributed into
  the volume of the envelope throught energy spots
  (class Par01EnergySpot), those energy spots being
  recorded in the sensitive detector at this point
  if any.  \n\n
  
  They are rather similar from a technical point of vue.
  They both make use of a private G4Navigator to set
  their energy spots into the sensitive volumes.
  However, we don't take care of putting every spot into
  a sensitive (which is recommended in a "serious"
  parameterisation !).  \n\n
  
  Those two models trigger their parameterisation
  on the first step the particle does in the envelope,
  but it would be perfectly possible to wait that the
  particle is far enough from the boundary of the envelope
  for example.  \n\n
  
  - Par01PiModel: just there to show how a parameterisation
    can create secondaries, but not used.  \n\n

- Par01PhysicsList::AddParameterisation(). A method which
  sets the G4FastSimulationManagerProcess in the process
  manager of all the particles. This process provides
  the INTERFACE between the tracking and the parameterisation
  models.  \n\n

- In Par01DetectorConstruction::Construct(): the parameterisation
  models are built and bound to envelopes:  \n\n
  
  - Par01EMShowerModel is bound to the electromagnetic
    calorimeter \n\n
    
  - Par01PionShowerModel is bound to a ghost volume
    which encompasses the electromagnetic and
    hadronic calorimters  \n\n

- The Physics list used is FTFP_BERT which is augmented using the
   G4FastSimulationPhysics physics constructor to insert the
   G4FastSimulationManagerProcess that is making the interface
   between the fast simulation and the tracking.
   The configuration is shown in examlePar01.cc.
