- modify ExN05RunAction  ExN05SteppingAction ExN05TrackingAction
- modify ExN05PhysicsList::SetCuts

11 December 1998 M. Verderi
- fix made in ExN05CalorimeterSD to allow several instanciations of this class.
  The problem was a static variable (HCID) used in EndOfEventAction which made
  confusion to get the hits collection. HCID is now put as private (non static!)
  member of the class.
- the example.in/.out are updated accordingly


9 December 1998 M. Verderi
- Added ExN05PionShowerModel: a model producing hits
  for pi+/pi-
- Modify ExN05EMShowerModel to produce a "less unrealistic"
  shower shape: now the longitudinal profile is according to
  the Gamma distribution. Transverse profile is two cylinder:
  the 1 moliere radius receive 90% of the energy, the 3.5 one
  receives the rest.
- Added RandomGamma: shoot at random according to the Gamma
  distribution. Adapted from RNGAMA function of KERNLIB.
  (thanks to D. Bernard who gave me the source).
- ExN05DetectorConstruction. Many changes:
	- EM calo size reduced, crytals also;
	- addition of an hadronic calorimeter
	- addition of a ghost volume
  The G4VFastSimulationModel are instanciated(?) here, and
  no more in exampleN05.cc
- exampleN05.in modified to shoot pions in order to test
  the ghost geometry.
- ExN05PhysicsList modified to add the parameterisation
  process as a Post&Along process, because of the ghost.



16th August 1998 H.Kurashige
- Added ExN05MinRangeCuts, ExN05MinEkineCuts, ExN05MaxTimeCuts
  and their base class of ExN05SpecialCuts for using UserLimits.
- Modified ExN05PhysicsList to register above processes.
- Modified ExN05DetectorConstruction to attach Userlimits to crystal.
- Added ExN05DetectorMessenger to switch on/off UserLimits.
- Modified exampleN05.in


9th August 1998  John Allison
- Changed G4UIterminal to G4UIGAG.

16th July 1998  John Allison
- Changed /vis~/Draw... to /vis~/draw.

June 26th 98 Marc Verderi:

Remove previous files, and add new ones with the
good (hopefully) naming conventions this time.
Improvements done in ExN05EMShowerModel by using
a private navigator, rather than the one for tracking.
