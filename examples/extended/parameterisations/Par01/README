                            Example Par01
                            -------------

Example Par01 provides examples of the use of parameterisation facilities.
It was moved in extended examples from novice/N05 with removal of
novice examples. 

Geometry, sensitive detector, hits, processes are defined respectively in:

	Par01DetectorConstruction
	Par01CalorimeterSD
	Par01CalorimeterHit

The particularities are:

      o The parameterisation models:

	      o Par01EMShowerModel which provides a crude
		parameterisation for e+/e-/gamma. This model
		is bound to the EM calorimeter.

	      o Par01PionShowerModel: an even more crude
		parameterisation for pi+/pi-. This model
		is bound to a ghost volume.

		Those two models produces "hits": ie the energy
		of the incident particle is distributed into
		the volume of the envelope throught energy spots
		(class Par01EnergySpot), those energy spots being
		recorded in the sensitive detector at this point
		if any.

		They are rather similar from a technical point of vue.
		They both make use of a private G4Navigator to set
		their energy spots into the sensitive volumes.
		However, we don't take care of putting every spot into
		a sensitive (which is recommended in a "serious"
		parameterisation !).

		Those two models trigger their parameterisation
		on the first step the particle does in the envelope,
		but it would be perfectly possible to wait that the
		particle is far enough from the boundary of the envelope
		for example.

	      o Par01PiModel: just there to show how a parameterisation
		can create secondaries, but not used.

      o Par01DetectorConstruction::Construct: in this method, the parameterisation
	models are built and bound to envelopes:

	      o Par01EMShowerModel is bound to the electromagnetic
		calorimeter

	      o Par01PionShowerModel is bound to a ghost volume
		which encompasses the electromagnetic and
		hadronic calorimters

      o The Physics list used is FTFP_BERT which is augmented using the
         G4FastSimulationPhysics physics constructor to insert the
	 G4FastSimulationManagerProcess that is making the interface
	 between the fast simulation and the tracking.
	 The configuration is shown in examlePar01.cc.
