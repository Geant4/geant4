/*! \page Examples_parameterisations Category "parameterisations"

 Examples in this directory demonstrate use of parameterisation libraries. 
 Currently, two examples are provided:

\link ExamplePar01 Par01 \endlink

This example demonstrates the use of parameterisation facilities.
It was moved in extended examples from novice/N05 with removal of
novice examples. 

\link ExamplePar02 Par02 \endlink

This example shows how to do "track and energy smearing" in Geant4,
in order to have a very fast simulation based on assumed detector
resolutions.

\link ExamplePar03 Par03 \endlink

This example demonstrates how to create  multiple energy deposits
from the fast simulation model and store it alongside deposits created
in full/detailed simulation.

\link Examples_gflash gflash \endlink

Set of examples demonstrating the use of the GFLASH parameterisation library.
