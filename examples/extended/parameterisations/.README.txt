/*! \page Examples_parameterisations Category "parameterisations"

 Examples in this directory demonstrate use of parameterisation libraries. 
 Currently, two examples are provided:

\link ExamplePar01 Par01 \endlink

This example demonstrates the use of parameterisation facilities.
It was moved in extended examples from novice/N05 with removal of
novice examples. 

\link ExamplePar02 Par02 \endlink

This example shows how to do "track and energy smearing" in Geant4,
in order to have a very fast simulation based on assumed detector
resolutions.

\link Examples_gflash gflash \endlink

Set of examples demonstrating the use of the GFLASH parameterisation library.
