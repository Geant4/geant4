                            Example Par04
                            -------------

 This example demonstrates how to use the Machine Learning (ML) inference
 to create energy deposits as a fast simulation model using
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime">ONNX runtime</a>
 and <a href="https://github.com/lwtnn/lwtnn">LWTNN</a> libraries.

 The model used in this example was trained externally (in Python) on data
 from this examples' full simulation and can be applied to perform fast simulation.
 The python scripts are availbale in the training folder.

 The geometry used in the example is a cylindrical setup of layers: tungsten
 absorber and silicon as the active material. 3D readout geometry (cylindrical)
 is defined dynamically,  based on the particle direction at the entrance to the
 calorimeter. This is set using a fast simulation model that is triggered at
 detector entrance. Analysis of energy deposits is done in the event action,
 ntuple with hits is stored.

 ## 1. Detector description

 The detector consists of cylindrical layers of passive and active material,
 tungsten and silicon, respectively.

 Fast simulation is attached to the region of the detector.

 Input macro can specify which layer is considered an active layer (sensitive
 detector is attached to it). For fast simulation both layers should be marked
 as sensitive. It is connected to the wway the deposits are created: position is
 centre of the layer, which may often fall within the absorber (which is thicker
 than the active material). In a realistic detector setup, the positions used in
 fast simulation would be calculated properly, to deposit energy within the active
 material.

 ## 2. Sensitive detector

 Sensitive detector inherits from both base classes:
 - G4VSensitiveDetector: for processing of detailed/non-fast simulation hits
 - G4VFastSimSensitiveDetector: for processing of fast sim (G4FastSim) hits.
 Hits are placed in the same hit collection, with a different flag to distinguish
 between those originated in the full simulation, and those from the fast
 simulation.
 During visualisation, hits are represented as volumes of different colour:
 green for full simulation and red for fast simulation.

 ## 3. Primary generation

 Particle gun is used as a primary generator. 10 GeV electron is used by default.
 By default particles are generated along y axis. Those values
 can be changed using /gun/ UI commands.

 ## 4. Physics List

 FTFP_BERT modular physics list is used. On top of it, fast simulation physics
 is registered for selected particles (electrons, positrons).


 ## 5. User actions

 - Par04RunAction : run action used for initialization and termination
                    of the run. Histograms for analysis of shower development
                    in the detector are created.

 - Par04EventAction : event action used for initialization and termination
                      of the event. Analysis of shower development is performed
                      on event-by-event basis.

 ## 6. ML Inference

 - Par04MLFastSimModel : model used for parametrisation of źelectrons, positrons,
      and gammas. Energy is deposited and
      distributed according to inferred values from the ML model.
      This class triggers the inference setup, asks for values,
      and deposits energies at given positions.

 - Par04InferenceSetup : this class is used to initialize the inference parameters
       (user application specific) such as the inference library,
      the path and name of the inference model and the size of
      the input inference vector(latent dimension and and condition size).
      This class constructs this vector and triggers the interface
      corresponding to the specified input inference library.
      After the inference, the post processing step consists of
      scaling back inferred values to the original range.

 - Par04InferenceInterface : is a base class that allows to read in the ML model, configure
       and execute inference.

 - Par04OnnxInference and Par04LWTNNInference : inference library specific classes that inherit
      from the base class Par04InferenceInterface.


 ## 7. Output

 The execution of the program (examplePar04) produces an output with histograms.
 Ntuples are also stored. They are not merged if the application is run on multiple threads.

 The macro file examplePar04.mac is used to run full simulation. It will simulate 100
 events, for single 10 GeV electron beams.
 If CMake is able to find inference libraries (lwtnn and/or ONNX Runtime), a configuration
 macro will be available for that library (examplePar04_lwtnn.mac and/or examplePar04_onnx.mac).
 It will use a trained model to run inference and create showers in the detector by directly
 depositing energy.

 ## 8. How to build and run the example

- LWTNN and ONNX Runtime are available on LCG. In order to use them, one can setup the envirnment:
  % source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_100/x86_64-centos7-gcc10-opt/setup.sh

- Compile and link to generate the executable (in your CMAKE build directory):
  % cmake <Par04_SOURCE>
  % make

- Execute the application (in batch mode):
  % ./examplePar04 -m examplePar04.mac
  which produces two root file for full simulation.

- Execute the application (in interactive mode):
  % ./examplePar04 -i -m vis.mac
  which allows to visualize hits (from full simulation).

- If ONNX Runtime is available:
  % ./examplePar04 -m examplePar04_onnx.mac
  For interactive mode with visualization:
  % ./examplePar04 -i -m vis_onnx.mac

- If LWTNN is available:
  % ./examplePar04 -m examplePar04_lwtnn.mac
  For interactive mode with visualization:
  % ./examplePar04 -i -m vis_lwtnn.mac

 By default, CMake will attempt to build fast simulation with ONNX Runtime and LWTNN. However, if none
 of those libraries is found, it will proceed with full simulation only. The search can be switched
 off manually switching CMake flag INFERENCE_LIB to OFF (-DINFERENCE_LIB=OFF)

 ## 9. Macros

 vis.mac - Allows to run visualization. Pass it to the example in interactive mode ("-i" passed to the executable).
           It can be used to visualize full simulation.

 vis_onnx.mac - Allows to run visualization with ONNX Runtime inference. Pass it to the example in interactive mode
              ("-i" passed to the executable). It contains ecessary settings of the inference, and it treats full
              calorimeter as sensitive material (due to deposition of hits regardless of the volume).

 vis_lwtnn.mac - Allows to run visualization with LWTNN inference. Pass it to the example in interactive mode
              ("-i" passed to the executable). It contains ecessary settings of the inference, and it treats full
              calorimeter as sensitive material (due to deposition of hits regardless of the volume).

 examplePar04.mac - Runs full simulation. It will run 100 events with single electrons, 10 GeV and
                   along y axis.

 ## 11. Python scripts for training

 The scripts available in the training folder were used to train
 the VAE model of this example.

 - model: defines the VAE model as a class which contains the architecture,
 the loss function and the training function.

 - utils: defines the data loading and preprocessing function and returns
 the preprocessed array of shower energies and the condition arrays of energy,
 angle and geometry. The input is expected to be in local directory 'detector_*'.
 In this example, the model is trained on 2 detector geometries and the input
 directories are 'detector_SiW' and 'detector_SciPb'. Each directory contains the
 HDF5 files for each primary particle energy and angle.

 - train: defines data loading parameters and calls the data preprocessing function.
 It defines the model parameters and instantiates the VAE model, performs the training
 and then coverts the model into an ONNX format.

    A history object is returned from the training function of the VAE. The history is a callback
    object registered during the training which records metrics for each epoch such as the loss.
    The user can list the metrics collected in the history object using:

      % print(history.history.keys())

    The data collected in the history object can be used to create plots such as the loss function
    as function of the epochs. If the loss metric collected in the history object is called loss,
    then to plot it using for example the matplotlib library:

      % matplotlib.pyplot.plot(history.history['loss'])

    The traing function can also generate intermediate files representing checkpoints of the model
    that can be used for validation purposes. These checkpoints are generated if the early stopping flag
    of the training is off, which means to train the model for the predefined number of epochs. The weights
    of the model are saved every 100 epochs.

    After the training, the model (only the decoder part) is saved as an HDF5 file and then is converted
    into an ONNX format. The final output model called Generator.onnx can be used to perform the inference
    in this example.

 To perform the training run:
  % python train.py
