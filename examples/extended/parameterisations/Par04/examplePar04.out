You may choose a graphics system (driver) with a parameter of
the command "/vis/open" or "/vis/sceneHandler/create",
or you may omit the driver parameter and choose at run time:
- by argument in the construction of G4VisExecutive
- by environment variable "G4VIS_DEFAULT_DRIVER"
- by entry in "~/.g4session"
- by build flags.
- Note: This feature is not allowed in batch mode.
For further information see "examples/basic/B1/exampleB1.cc"
and "vis.mac".

--- Detector length:	2 m  
--- Detector inner radius:	80 cm 
--- Number of layers:	90

--- 1st layer: 	1.4 mm  of passive G4_W
--- 2nd layer: 	300 um  of active G4_Si
-----------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------
 Readout geometry with physics layout is set in parallel geometry:	
 Cylindrical detector is divided along radius (layers), phi (slices), and z (rows).
 Number of layers is determined by number of layers set in detector construction. 
- Number of layers: 90
------- Number of slices: 320
- Number of rows: 100
 Readout will collect energy for full simulation.
------- Therefore thickness is only a thickness of sensitive absorbers = 300 um
