 Example of use GDML reader/writer in  Detector Construction
 -----------------------------------------------------------

 In this directory you can find a example showing how to use GDML module for
 reading and writing. It is also shown how to Read STEP Tools files.
 In this example the DetectorConstruction consists of a Simple Detector, then
 this Detector is filled/written in GDML.
 The different options for writing and reading GDML files are shown in the
 Detector Construction: writing modular files, using different schema location,
 setting parameters for names in GDML file, etc.
 For more information, please, refer to the GDML Documentation.
  
 The Geometry is a Simple Detector Box with 4 Subdetectors. 
 This setup shows how to use Reflection Factory, Assembly of Volumes and
 Parameterisation. 
 Using commands or macros it possible to read or write GDML file.
  
 HOW TO BUILD THE EXAMPLE ?
 
 - You need to have built the persistency/gdml module by having
   set the -DGEANT4_USE_GDML=ON flag during the CMAKE configuration step, 
   as well as the -DXERCESC_ROOT_DIR=<path_to_xercesc> flag pointing to 
   the path where the XercesC XML parser package is installed in your system.
 
 - Compile and link to generate the executable (in your CMAKE build directory):
               % make
 
 - Execute the application:
               % geotest [macro-file].mac

 You can run this application with the following macro file:
   
    write_gdml.mac : This macro will write the Geometry defined in file
                     "test.gdml" and output to a new file wtest.gdml
                     To change this name you can use command :
                     /mydet/writeFile FileName.gdml

    read_gdml.mac : This macro will read the Geometry from file "test.gdml"
                     To change this name you can use command :
                     /mydet/readFile FileName.gdml

    read_step.mac : This macro will read the STEP Tool files "mbb.geom" and
                    "mbb.tree" and load them in memory.
                     To change this name you can use command :
                     /mydet/StepFile FileName
