\section G04_s1 GDML DETECTOR SENSITIVITY
                    
This example demonstrates the usage of the GDML auxiliary information for
associating a sensitive detector to a volume.

The detector construction consists of a call to GDMLProcessor which parses a
GDML file and returns the pointer to the world volume. The user can also write
her/his own GDML file and use it as the primary input format for her/his Geant4
application.

A simple GDML files is provided:
- auxiliary.gdml, showing association of a volume with the auxiliary
  information, related to the sensitive detector.

\section G04_s2 HOW TO BUILD THE EXAMPLE ?

- You need to have built the persistency/gdml module by having
  set the -DGEANT4_USE_GDML=ON flag during the CMAKE configuration step, 
  as well as the -DXERCESC_ROOT_DIR=path_to_xercesc flag pointing to 
  the path where the XercesC XML parser package is installed in your system.

- Compile and link to generate the executable (in your CMAKE build directory):
\verbatim
% make
\endverbatim

- Execute the application for parsing interactively the GDML file:
\verbatim
% gdml_det auxiliary.gdml
\endverbatim
