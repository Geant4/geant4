                     GDML detector sensitivity
                     -------------------------

This example demonstrates the usage of the GDML auxiliary information for
associating a sensitive detector to a volume.

The detector construction consists of a call to GDMLProcessor which parses a
GDML file and returns the pointer to the world volume. The user can also write
her/his own GDML file and use it as the primary input format for her/his Geant4
application.

A simple GDML files is provided:
- auxiliary.gdml, showing association of a volume with the auxiliary
  information, related to the sensitive detector.

HOW TO BUILD THE EXAMPLE ?

- You need to have built the persistency/gdml module by having
  set the -DGEANT4_USE_GDML=ON flag during the CMAKE configuration step, 
  as well as the -DXERCESC_ROOT_DIR=<path_to_xercesc> flag pointing to 
  the path where the XercesC XML parser package is installed in your system.
 
- Compile and link to generate the executable (in your CMAKE build directory):
 	      % make

- Execute the application.
  o For parsing interactively the GDML file:
 	      % gdml_det auxiliary.gdml
