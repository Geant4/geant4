 Example of use GDML extension and associated reader
 -----------------------------------------------------------

 In this directory you can find an example showing how to extend the GDML
 schema and plug-in a custom reader to the system for handling the extension.
 For more information, please, refer to the GDML Documentation.
  
 The Geometry is a Simple Box to which it is assigned a color as
 visualization attribute.
 The entity "color" is defined as part of the "extension" tag and properly
 implemented in the GDML schema extension placed inside the directory
 SimpleExtensionSchema.
 The GDML file implenting the geometry with colors extension is
 color_extension.gdml, in which the standard "gdml" tag has been replaced
 by the "gdml_simple_extension" tag, with relative location for the new schema.
 The GDML file is automatically loaded by the program.
 It is also possible to use UI commands or macros as arguments to read any
 standard GDML file.
  
 HOW TO BUILD THE EXAMPLE ?
 
 - You need to have built the persistency/gdml plugin module along with the
   Geant4 libraries, by having set the G4LIB_BUILD_GDML variable in your
   environment.
   It is also required to specify the path where the XercesC XML parser
   package is installed in your system, through the variable XERCESCROOT.
 
 - Compile and link to generate the executable:
               % gmake
 
 - Execute the application:
               % read_ext [macro-file.mac]
