                          PersEx01: ROOT I/O example
                          ==========================

This example demonstrates how to store calorimeter hits using ROOT I/O.
Example sensitive detector and hits (Pers01CalorimeterSD and Pers01CalorHit)
are taken from the novice example N03.

*** Making libraries ***

First you need to make Geant4 ROOT I/O libraries.

You may need to set up ROOT environment variables.

  setenv ROOTSYS /usr/local/root/v3.03.06/root
  setenv PATH $ROOTSYS/bin:$PATH

In Addition, you may also need to set up LD_LIBRARY_PATH, depending on
the ROOT version.

  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $ROOTSYS/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Note: ROOT 3.03.08 is known to cause problems with Geant4 ROOT I/O.

Then you make libG4ROOTIO.so by typing 

  cd G4INSTALL/examples/extented/persistency/rootio
  make

The library module will be built into $G4PEX_LIB.
 (G4INSTALL/examples/extented/persistency/rootio/lib/$G4SYSTEM)


*** Making executable module G4PersEx01 ***

  cd G4INSTALL/examples/extented/persistency/PersEx01
  make

By doing this, you create libG4PersEx01.so in $G4PEX_LIB, and
the executable module G4PersEx01 in $G4PEX_BIN.
 (G4INSTALL/examples/extented/persistency/rootio/bin/$G4SYSTEM)

By running "run" script provided in this directory, hits information
will be stored into a file G4run0001.root.

  ./run


*** Reading the ROOT file ***

You can read the hit ROOT file G4run0001.root with HitsAnalyzer.

  cd HitsAnalyzer
  make
  ./run


*** Some Documentation ***

In G4run0001.root, there is a ROOT tree called "Geant4".
Hits information is stored as a branch under this tree,
and the calorimeter hits in the above example are stored
into the branch "CalCollection".

Now take a look of a macro file "run.mac", which gives the
necessary commands to enable Geant4 ROOT I/O.

-------------------------------------------------------
/persistency/verbose 1
/persistency/select ROOT
/persistency/store/using/hitIO  CalorSD     CalCollection
#                              <IOmanager> <collectionName>
/persistency/set/writeFile/Hits  G4run0001.root
/persistency/printall
-------------------------------------------------------

On line#2, ROOT I/O package is selected.
On line#3, you must provide the same sensitive detector name
as you named to Pers01CarorimeterSD in the file
Pers01DetectorConstruction.cc.
On line#4, file name for the hits output is specified.


*** Root I/O Adopter classes ***

In the subdirectory rootio, there is a file called Pers01CalorHit.rootio
which is used to generate a set of ROOT I/O adopter classes.
Following files are generated automatically with this file by using
a perl script "g4rootio.pl".

  Pers01CalorHitRoot.hh    Pers01CalorHitRoot.cc
  Pers01CalorHitsRoot.hh   Pers01CalorHitsRoot.cc
  Pers01CalorHitRootIO.hh  Pers01CalorHitRootIO.cc

The contents of Pers01CalorHit.rootio may look like this:

-------------------------------------------------------
#
# File: Pers01CalorHit.rootio
#
#  Author: <youhei.morita@kek.jp>
#
#  Usage:
#    Use g4rootio.pl to generate ROOT I/O adapter classes:
#      % g4rootio.pl Pers01CalorHit.rootio
#    This will generate the following files:
#      Pers01CalorHitRoot.hh/cc, Pers01CalorHitsRoot.hh/cc, 
#      Pers01CalorHitRootIs.hh/cc
#
set class_name Pers01CalorHit
set collection_class Pers01CalorHitsCollection
set collection_base_class G4VHitsCollection
set array_io_base G4VPHitsCollectionIO
set catalog G4HCIOentryT
set sdet_name CalorSD
set add_header
  @class_name@.hh
..
set member
  @float@ EdepAbs;
  @float@ EdepGap;     
  @float@ TrackLengthAbs;
  @float@ TrackLengthGap;     
..

set constructor
  @class_root@(@class_name@* hit)
  {
    EdepAbs = hit->GetEdepAbs();
    EdepGap = hit->GetEdepGap();
    TrackLengthAbs = hit->GetTrakAbs();
    TrackLengthGap = hit->GetTrakGap();
  }
..

set method
  @class_name@* @make_transient@()
  {
    @class_name@* hit = new @class_name@();
    hit->AddAbs(EdepAbs, TrackLengthAbs);
    hit->AddGap(EdepGap, TrackLengthGap);
    return hit;
  }
..

*** About g4rootio.pl ***

In Geant4, various types of hits information from each subdetector
must be recorded into the file.  For the developer of each
subdetector, the type of information for each hit is important
and the I/O mechanism can be similar to each other.  g4rootio.pl
enables an automatic generation of ROOT I/O adopter classes from
a simple definition file *.rootio.


*** Limitations of g4rootio.pl ***

g4rootio.pl generates a large collection of a simple hit class
by using an array class (TClonesArray) as a container.

For the moment, g4rootio.pl limits itself to store only a simple
data types, such as @int@, @uint@, @float@, @char@, or a fixed
length array of these types, or a simple concrete class containing
only those simple types.

g4rootio.pl is not capable of storing data members with pointers
or variable length array such as char* or std::string.  For the
charaters, you may need to use fixed length array such as char[20].


*** How to write Pers01CalorHit.rootio ***

To store and retrieve a collection of transient class Pers01CalorHit,
you create a file Pers01CalorHit.rootio.

In *.rootio, you may use macro such as @class_name@.  See the later
section of this document about detail description of the macros.

Normally you may need to edit the name of the following classes.

set class_name Pers01CalorHit                    # name of the original transient class
set collection_class Pers01CalorHitsCollection   # name of the original hit collection transient class

Following examples are universal for standard Geant4 hits.
You may need to change them to digits if you are dealing with digits class.

set collection_base_class G4VHitsCollection      # base class of the transient hits collection
set array_io_base VPHitsCollectionIO             # base class of the Hits I/O manager
set catalog HCIOentryT                           # name of the Hit I/O catalog

In the next section you declare the data members which you want to
store and retrieve.  In this example, four simple Float_t variables
EdepAbs, EdepGap, TrackLengthAbs, TrackLengthGap are declared.

This command takes several input lines, so you need to terminate 
with a line ".." by itself.

set member
  @float@ EdepAbs;
  @float@ EdepGap;     
  @float@ TrackLengthAbs;
  @float@ TrackLengthGap;     
..

Next you need to design a constructor for the ROOT I/O persistent
class Pers01CalorHitRoot.  A macro @class_root@ will be replaced
with "Pers01CalorHitROot", and @class_name@ will become "Pers01CalorHit".

In the constructor, copy the values of the transient class into the
data members of @class_root@.

This command takes several input lines, so you need to terminate 
with a line ".." by itself.

set constructor
  @class_root@(@class_name@* hit)
  {
    EdepAbs = hit->GetEdepAbs();
    EdepGap = hit->GetEdepGap();
    TrackLengthAbs = hit->GetTrakAbs();
    TrackLengthGap = hit->GetTrakGap();
  }
..

The method "@make_transient@ is called duing a retrieve of events.
In this method you specify how to reproduce the instance of the
transient class @class_name@, by using the stored data member
values of @class_root@.

This command takes several input lines, so you need to terminate 
with a line ".." by itself.

set method
  @class_name@* @make_transient@()
  {
    @class_name@* hit = new @class_name@();
    hit->AddAbs(EdepAbs, TrackLengthAbs);
    hit->AddGap(EdepGap, TrackLengthGap);
    return hit;
  }
..


*** List of available macros ***
@class_name@             name of the original transient class
@class_root@             name of the correspondent root class
@class_array@            name of the collection of the root class
@class_io@               name of the I/O manager class
@collection_class@       name of the collection of the transient class
@collection_base_class@  name of the base class of the transient collection
@catalog@                catalog of the I/O manager class
@entry_object@           -internal use-
@entry_name@             -internal use-
                          (used in /persistency/store/using/hitIO<IOmanager>)
@make_transient@         -internal use- (MakeTransientObject)


*** Data type macros ***
@int@             Int_t
@uint@            UInt_t
@float@           Float_t
@char@            char


*** Use of the generic hits collection class ***

In the above example, hits collection is made of a template class
G4THitsCollection<T>.

  typedef G4THitsCollection<Pers01CalorHit> Pers01CalorHitsCollection;

In this case, *.rootio may remain as above.

However, in some circumstances it would be required to use
a base hits collection class other than G4THitsCollecton.
g4rootio.pl provides a way to work with this situation.

You may add addtional directives to the *.rootio file.

  set collection_class_header yes

This command tells the hits collection header file is separated
from the transient hit class.

  set collection_class_method_entries Size()
  set collection_class_method_add     Insert(hit)
  set collection_class_method_get     GetHit(i)

You may specify the method names for the entries of the transient
hit class, adding a hit to the collection, or referencing the i-th
hit entry in the collection. (In this example, the variable name
"hit" is a place holder, and will be ignored in the actual
implementation.)

  set collection_class_signature @collection_class@(f_detName, f_colName, 0)

This command gives a non-standard signature of the collection class
constructor.  Note that f_detName and f_colName are required and
cannot be omitted.  For other variables, it can take only explicit
numbers such as 0, or 1.

Example: Suppose MDTHitsCollection just has the following type of constructor.

  MDTHitsCollection(G4String detName, G4String colName, MDTSensitiveDetector* sd);

Then the retrieved MDTHitsCollection has 0 as the 3rd argument.
It is users responsibility to fill this variable properly.


*** Generation of the ROOT I/O Adopter classes ***

ROOT I/O adopter classes can be generated automatically with the
GNUmakefiles provided in the $G4PEX_DIR/config directory.
"make clean" will cleans up your directory.

If you want to generate these file manually, type:

% $G4PEX_DIR/config/fadsrootio.pl rootio/Pers01CalorHit.rootio
