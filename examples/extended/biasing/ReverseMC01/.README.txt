\section ReverseMC01_abstract Abstract

This is the README file for the first G4 example illustrating the use of the Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) mode in a Geant4 
application. The  Reverse Monte Carlo method is also known as the Adjoint Monte Carlo (AMC) method  and 
in this document we will alternate both Reverse and Adjoint terms.

Geant4 User guide for application developers.


\section ReverseMC01_s1 Definition of Reverse/Adjoint Monte Carlo 

When the sensitive part of a detector is small compared  to its entire size and to the size  of the
external extended primary particle source,  a lot of computing time is spent during a normal Monte Carlo run 
in the simulation of  particle showers that are not contributing to the detector signal.  
In such particular case the Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) method, also known as the 
Adjoint Monte Carlo method, can be used. 
In this method  particles are generated  in or on the external surface of the sensitive  volume 
of the instrument and then are tracked backward in the geometry till they reach  the source surface, 
or exceed an energy threshold. During the reverse tracking reverse reactions are applied to the particles.



\section ReverseMC01_s2 The Reverse Monte Carlo mode in Geant4 (since G4.9.3 release)

(See also the section 3.7.3 Adjoint/Reverse Monte carlo in the 
Geant4 User guide for application developers.)

Different G4Adjoint classes have been implemented into the Geant4 
toolkit to run an adjoint/reverse simulation in a Geant4 application.
In this implementation an adjoint run is divided in a succession 
of alternative adjoint and forward tracking  of adjoint and normal particles.
One Geant4 event treats one of this tracking phase.


\subsection ReverseMC01_sub_s2_1 Reverse tracking phase

Adjoint particles (adjoint_e-, adjoint_gamma,...) are generated one by one on the so called
adjoint source with random position, energy (1/E distribution) and direction. The adjoint
source is the external surface of a user defined volume or of a user defined sphere. The 
adjoint source should contain one or several sensitive volumes and should be small 
compared to the entire geometry. The user can set the minimum and maximum energy of the 
adjoint source. After its generation the adjoint primary particle is tracked backward in
the geometry till a user defined external surface (spherical or boundary of a volume) 
or is killed before if it reaches a user defined upper energy limit that represents the
maximum energy of the external source. During the reverse tracking, reverse processes take 
place where the adjoint particle being tracked can be either scattered or transformed in 
another type of adjoint particle. During the reverse tracking the 
G4AdjointSimulationManager replaces the user defined primary, run, stepping, ... actions, 
by its own actions. 

\subsection ReverseMC01_sub_s2_2 Forward tracking phase:

When an adjoint particle reaches the external surface its weight, type,  position, 
and direction are registered and a  normal primary particle with a type equivalent 
to the last generated adjoint primary is generated with the same energy, 
position but opposite direction  and is  tracked in the forward direction 
in the sensitive region as in a forward MC simulation. 
During this forward tracking phase the  event, stacking, stepping, tracking actions defined 
by the user for its general forward application are used. 
By this clear separation between adjoint and forward tracking phases, the code of the 
user developed for a forward simulation should be only slightly 
modified to adapt it for an adjoint simulation. Indeed  the computation of the signal 
is done by the same user actions or analysis classes that the one used in the forward 
simulation mode.  Before the G4.10.0 release the reverse and forward tracking mode 
took place  in separated  events. Since the G4.10.0 release, 
in order to preapre to  the migration of the 
ReverseMC to the G4 Multiple Threading mode, the reverse and forward tracking
phase of corresponding adjoint and forward primaries have been merged in the same 
event.


\subsection ReverseMC01_sub_s2_3 Reverse Processes

During the reverse tracking phase reverse processes act on the adjoint particles.
The Reverse processes that  are available at the moment in Geant4 are the:
	- Reverse discrete  Ionization for e-, proton and ions
	- Continuous gain of energy by ionization and bremsstrahlung for e- and by ionization for protons and ions
	- Reverse discrete e- bremsstrahlung  
	- Reverse photoelectric effect 
	- Reverse Compton scattering
	- Approximated multiple scattering (MS) (see section 5.3)
		

It is important to note that the electromagnetic reverse processes are cut dependent 
as their equivalent forward processes. The implementation of the reverse processes is
 based on the forward processes
implemented in the G4 standard electromagnetic package.		     


\subsection ReverseMC01_sub_s2_4 Remark on Nb of adjoint particle types and  Nb of G4 events considered in an adjoint simulation

The list of type of adjoint and forward particles that are generated on the adjoint source
and considered in the simulation is a function of the adjoint processes declared in the 
physics list. For example if only the e- and gamma electromagnetic processes are considered
, only adjoint e- and adjoint gamma will be considered as primaries. In this case an 
adjoint event will be divided in two G4 events. The first event will  consist 
into  the coupled  reverse and forward  tracking of an adjoint e- and its equivalent 
forward e-, while the second events will process the reverse and forward trackings
of corresponsing adjoint and forward primary gamms. In this case a 
run of 100 adjoint events will consist into 200 Geant4 events. If the proton ionization is
also considered adjoint and forward protons  are also generated as primaries 
and 300 Geant4 events are processed for 100 adjoint events.

\subsection ReverseMC01_sub_s2_5 Modifications to bring in a existing G4 application to use the Reverse MC method

(for more details see also the section 3.7.3 Adjoint/Reverse Monte carlo in the 
Geant4 User guide for application developers.)

Due the clear separation  between the reverse and forward  tracking  phase  only few modifications are needed 
to an existing  Geant4 application in order to adapt it for the use of the reverse simulation mode.
Except in the physics list where all the reverse processes and their forward equivalent 
have to be declared, the principal code modifications  are needed only in the analysis phase at the end 
of the forward tracking where computed signals have to be multiplied by the weight 
of the last reverse tracks and then normalized to different user defined spectra and angular distribution representing 
the external source.
The weight of the adjoint tracks is computed by the G4Adjoint classes and the user needs
only to multiply them to the primary differential, directional spectrum of its choice. 
The adjoint weight a the end  of tracks can be also registered if needed in answer matrices.
 
More precisely, in order to be able to use the Reverse MC method in his simulation, the user should modify 
its code as such:
  
  - Adapt its physics list to use Reverse Processes for adjoint particles. An example of such physics list is provided in an extended 
	  example. 
  - Create an instance of    G4AdjointSimManager somewhere in the main () code.
  
  - Modify the analysis part of the code to normalize the signal computed during the forward phase to the weight of the last adjoint particle
	 that reaches the external surface. This is done by using the following method of G4AdjointSimManager:
	    - G4int GetIDOfLastAdjParticleReachingExtSource()				     
  	    - G4ThreeVector GetPositionAtEndOfLastAdjointTrack(){ return last_pos;}
	    - G4ThreeVector GetDirectionAtEndOfLastAdjointTrack(){ return last_direction;}
	    - G4double GetEkinAtEndOfLastAdjointTrack(){ return last_ekin;} 
	    - G4double GetEkinNucAtEndOfLastAdjointTrack(){ return last_ekin_nuc;}
	    - G4double GetWeightAtEndOfLastAdjointTrack(){return last_weight;}
            - G4double GetCosthAtEndOfLastAdjointTrack(){return last_cos_th;}
   	    - G4String GetFwdParticleNameAtEndOfLastAdjointTrack(){return last_fwd_part_name;}
   	    - G4int GetFwdParticlePDGEncodingAtEndOfLastAdjointTrack(){return last_fwd_part_PDGEncoding;}
            - G4int GetFwdParticleIndexAtEndOfLastAdjointTrack().

     In order to have a code working for both forward and adjoint simulation mode, the extra code needed in user actions for the adjoint
     simulation mode can be separated to the code needed only for the normal forward  simulation by using the following method:
	   - G4bool GetAdjointSimMode() that return true if   an adjoint simulation is running and false if not!



\section ReverseMC01_s3 exampleRMC01

The example RMC01 illustrates how to modify a G4 application in order to use 
both forward and reverse MC modes in the same code.
	   
	
\subsection ReverseMC01_sub_s3_1  Geometry
 
The following simple geometry is considered:
   - sensitive Silicon cylinder at the center of an Aluminum spherical shielding with 10 cm  Radius.
   - two 0.5mm thick Tantalum plates set horizontally above and below the Sensitive Cylinder 

The free parameters of the geometry that can bes set by the user are:
   - the thickness of the Aluminum shielding  
   - the height of the sensitive Si cylinder
   - the radius of the sensitive Si cylinder
      
 

\subsection ReverseMC01_sub_s3_2  Physics

The physical processes considered  are:
	- Reverse and forward discrete  Ionization for e- and  proton	
	- Continuous gain and loss of energy by ionization and bremsstrahlung for e- and by ionization for protons 
	- Reverse and forward discrete e- bremsstrahlung  
	- Reverse and forward photoelectric effect 
	- Reverse and forward Compton scattering
	- Reverse and forward Multiple scattering

These processes are implemented in the class G4AdjointPhysicsList distributed with the example. The G4AdjointPhysicsMessenger allows the user
to switch on/off some processes for testing purpose. By default all processes cited above are considered except the proton ionization that
has to be specifically switch on in the macro file by the user.



\subsection ReverseMC01_sub_s3_3 Analysis and output of the code

The example computes the energy deposited in the sensitive Si cylinder and the current of e-, protons, and gamma 
entering this cylinder.
The Hits are registered in the sensitive detector class RMC01SD that is a typical G4 sensitive detector class 
used in a forward simulation and is not modified at all
for the adjoint simulation mode. 
The analysis of the registered hits during forward events is done by the RMCO1AnalysisManager.
That is the class that illustrates how to adapt an analysis code of a fwd simulation in order to use it also for 
an adjoint simulation.
In this class during a forward simulation the  method EndOfEventForForwardSimulation is used at the end of an event 
while during an adjoint simulation at the end of fwd tracking event the method EndOfEventForAdjointSimulation is called.
By looking at the source of RMCO1AnalysisManager and more particularly to its method EndOfEventForAdjointSimulation the user will
learn how to adapt its G4 analysis code for an adjoint simulation.

The outputs of an adjoint simulation are:

 - The total energy deposited and particle current entering the sensitive cylinder normalized 
  automatically to a user defined primary spectrum(exponential or power law) .These results are stored in the files:
   - Adj_Edep_vs_EkinPrim.txt                            
   - Adj_ElectronCurrent.txt
   - Adj_GammaCurrent.txt
   - Adj_ProtonCurrent.txt
   - ConvergenceOfAdjointSimulationResults.txt: 
                         The total normalized edep and its relative error registered every 5000 adjoint events
         
         
 - The answer matrix of the energy deposited and particles current on the sensitive cylinder in function of primary energy of e-, gamma and
 protons. These results are stored in the files Adj********_Answer.txt
		   	
		 
	
The outputs of a forward simulation are:	 
  - The mean energy deposited and particle current entering the sensitive cylinder per event.
   These results are stored in the files:
   - Fwd_Edep_vs_EkinPrim.txt                            
   - Fwd_ElectronCurrent.txt
   - Fwd_GammaCurrent.txt
   - Fwd_ProtonCurrent.txt
          
 

\subsection ReverseMC01_sub_s3_4 Run macrofiles

The following example run macro files are distributed with the code:
  - run_adjoint_simulation_electron.mac and  run_adjoint_simulation_proton.mac for adjoint simulations 

  - run_forward_simulation_electron.mac  and run_forward_simulation_proton.mac for forward simulations
	

\subsection ReverseMC01_sub_s3_5 Comparison of adjoint and forward simulation results

It is the responsibility of the user to select in the macro file the same external spectrum 
for both the forward and adjoint simulations  and to normalize the per event results of the forward simulation 
to the fluence considered in the adjoint  simulation. 

For the macro files that are provided  with the examples it consists into multiplying  the forward results by pi*100.
This normalization factor is explained by the following:
	
  - For the forward simulation the results are given  per number of events. It corresponds  
    to a normalization to a  fluence of 1 particle emanating from the external source. 

  - In run_fwd_simulation.mac the source is set on a sphere of 10 cm radius (see /gps commands in
    macrofile).Therefore the omnidirectional  fluence for the fwd simulation  is 1./(pi*R^2) with R=10cm. 

  - The adjoint results  are normalized to a fluence of 1/cm2.
    (See command /RMC01/analysis/SetExponentialSpectrumForAdjointSim in macrofile)

  - In conclusion to compare the adjoint and forward results, the forward results should
			be multiplied by pi*R^2/cm2= pi*100.



\section ReverseMC01_s4 Control of the adjoint simulation and the RMC01 code by G4 macro UI commands

Different G4 macro UI commands are provided to control the RMC01 example and the adjoint simulation.
Some macro commands are provided within the geant4 toolkit and appears in a G4 application when the singleton 
class G4AdjointSimManager is called somewhere in the code, the other macro commands are

 potential candidates are (e-, gamma, proton , ion). For this example only e-, gamma, proton
 can be chosen. As the proton ionization is not considered by default, the default list of particles is
 [e-,gamma]. To have also the proton as candidate the proton ionization should 
 be switch on (/adjoint_physics/UseProtonIonisation true).

- /adjoint/NeglectAsPrimary  particle_name \n

 The type  of particle specified by  "particle_name" will be removed from the list of primary adjoint particles. 
 The list of candidates depends on the reverse physics processes considered in the simulation. At the most the 
 potential candidates are (e-, gamma, proton , ion). For this example only e-, gamma, proton
 can be chosen. As the proton ionization is not considered by default, the default list of particles is

	to 0. meaning that the run will not be aborted in this case. 
	  
	




\section ReverseMC01_s5 Known issues

\subsection ReverseMC01_sub_s5_1 Rare too high weight in the adjoint simulation

In rare cases an adjoint track may get a much too high weight when  reaching the external source.
While this happen not often it may corrupt the simulation results significantly. The reason  of this high weight is 
the joint use at low e- and gamma  energy of both  the photoelectric and bremsstrahlung processes.
Unfortunately we still need some investigations to remove this problem  at the level of physical processes. 
However  this problem can be solved  at the level of event action in the user code by adding a test on the adjoint 
weight. Such test has been implemented in the example RMC01. 
In this implementation  an event is rejected when the relative error of the computed  normalised edep 
increase during one event by more than 50% when the precision  is already below 10%.
 

\subsection ReverseMC01_sub_s5_2 Limitation of the reverse bremsstrahlung

The difference between the differential cross sections used in the adjoint and forward bremsstrahlung 
 models is the source of a higher flux of >100 keV gamma in the reverse simulation compared to the forward simulation.
The adjoint processes/models should make use of the direct differential cross section to sample
 the adjoint  secondaries and compute the adjoint cross section.
The differential cross section used in G4AdjointeBremstrahlungModel  is obtained by the numerical derivation
over the cut energy of the direct cross section provided  by G4eBremsstrahlungModel. 
This would be a correct procedure if the  distribution of secondary in   G4eBremsstrahlungModel  
would match this differential cross section. Unfortunately it is not the case as independent  parameterization are used 
 in   G4eBremsstrahlungModel  for both the cross sections and the sample of secondary. (It means that in the forward case 
 if one would integrate the effective differential cross section considered  in the simulation we would not find back 
 the used cross section). 
 In the future we plan to correct this problem by using an extra weight correction factor after the occurrence of a reverse
 bremsstrahlung. This weight factor should be the ratio between the differential CS used in the adjoint simulation and the 
one effectively used in the forward processes. As it is impossible to have access to the forward differential CS 
 in G4eBremsstrahlungModel we  are investigating the feasibility to use  the differential CS considered in  
 G4Penelope models. 
   

\subsection ReverseMC01_sub_s5_3 Limitation of the reverse multiple scattering

For the reverse multiple scattering we are using the same models than for the forward case.
This approximation makes that the discrepancy between the adjoint and forward 
simulation cases can get to a level of ~ 10-15% relative differences in the test cases that we have considered. 
In the future we plan to improve   the adjoint multiple scattering models  by forcing the computation of 
multiple scattering effect at the end of an adjoint step.
