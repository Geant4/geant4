\page ExampleB02 Example B02

This example uses a parallel geometry to define G4GeometryCell objects
for scoring and importance sampling. The output should be equivalent to B01.

A modular approach is applied to the physicslist and the extension for biasing.
The parallel geometry is included in this extension.
