- Replaced vis manager with G4VisExecutive.

March 17th, 2005 G.Daquino - B02-V07-00-00
- porting B02 from PI working with rh73 to PI working with slc3

Jun 18th, 2004  G.Daquino - B02-V06-01-00
- porting B02 from Anaphe (Lizard) to PI. Actually, PI 1.2.1 still DOES NOT
  allow the plotting in the same way, previously set in Anaphe. Therefore the
  HBOOk file produced at the end of the example still needs other packages to
  be displayed. However, future PI releases could contain python modules with
  this property.
  README file has been updated accordingly.
