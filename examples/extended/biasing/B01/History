                      Category History file
                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !
