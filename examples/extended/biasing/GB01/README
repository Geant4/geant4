                Example GB01 : cross-section biasing
                ------------------------------------

    This example illustrates how to bias process cross-sections.

    Generally speaking, the scheme consists of a G4VBiasingOperator that takes
decisions on what sort of biasing is to be applied. The operator makes these
decision on requests of the G4BiasingProcessInterface process. This process
wraps an actual physics process and asks to the operator about what sort of
biasing it should apply. This operator selects G4VBiasingOperation objects that
implement the actual biasing content.

    In the present case, the G4VBiasingOperation objects are

                        G4BOptnChangeCrossSection

instances. This class is defined in processes/biasing/generic.

    A first operator is defined to handle the case of one particle:

                        GB01BOptrChangeCrossSection .

The change of cross-section is generally speaking a change of process occurence.
G4BOptnChangeCrossSection objets are then selected in the method:

      G4VBiasingOperation* ProposeOccurenceBiasingOperation(...)

of the GB01BOptrChangeCrossSection operator.


    To allow this same cross-section change to be applied to several particle
types, an other operator is defined

                   GB01BOptrMultiParticleChangeCrossSection

which holds one GB01BOptrChangeCrossSection per particle type, and which
delegates then everything to it.

    The geometry is simple : a single volume to which an instance of
GB01BOptrMultiParticleChangeCrossSection is attached to.

    The wrapping of physics processes by G4BiasingProcessInterface processes
is simply handled by the G4GenericBiasingPhysics physics constructor, as shown
in the main program.


    Then, at whatever level (stepping action, or sensitive detector) the
statistical weight of the track can be obtained as:

                        w = track->GetWeight() ;
