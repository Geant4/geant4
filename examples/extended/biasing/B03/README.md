\page ExampleB03 Example B03

This example uses a parallel geometry to define G4GeometryCell objects
for scoring and importance sampling. The output should be statistically 
equivalent to [B02](../../html_B02/html/ExampleB02.html) 
(and [B01](../../html_B01/html/ExampleB01.html)).

This demonstrates a customised "flat" physics implementation with the addition
of biasing. Complementary approach to the modular physics lists of B01 and B02

See also [Category "biasing"](../../html/Examples_biasing.html) documentation.
