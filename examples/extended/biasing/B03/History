# Example B03 History

See `CONTRIBUTING.rst` for details of **required** info/format for each entry,
which **must** added in reverse chronological order (newest at the top). It must **not**
be used as a substitute for writing good git commit messages!

# History entries prior to 11.0

March 18th, 2021 Alberto Ribon - B03-V10-07-02
- B03PhysicsList : replaced G4HadronCaptureProcess with
  G4NeutronCaptureProcess, and G4HadronFissionProcess with
  G4NeutronFissionProcess.

March 8th, 2021 Alberto Ribon - B03-V10-07-01
- B03PhysicsList : replaced old ion cross sections (that have been deleted)
  with better ones.

March 4th, 2021 Alberto Ribon - B03-V10-07-00
- B03PhysicsList : use G4HadronInelasticProcess for inelastic processes
  (the particle-specific inelastic processes have been deleted).

November 10th, 2020 Ben Morgan - B03-V10-06-00
- Migration to G4RunManagerFactory.

May 29th, 2019 V. Ivanchenko  - B03-V10-05-01
- B03PhysicsList : use G4NeutronInelasticXS cross section

May 10th, 2019 V. Ivanchenko  - B03-V10-05-00
- B03PhysicsList : explicitly defined hadronic x-sections

Aug 9th, 2018 A. Ribon  - B03-V10-04-02
- B03PhysicsList : replaced the explicit high-energy limit of hadronic
  physics with the one from G4HadronicParameters .

May 8th, 2018 B. Morgan - B03-V10-04-01
- Include G4Types before use of G4MULTITHREADED. For forward
  compatibility with move to #defines over -D for G4 preprocessor
  symbols.

Feb 15th, 2018 A. Howard - B03-V10-04-00
- Removed parallel geometry setting directly from main - created a data-race
  in MT mode. Now everything is handled with B03PhysicsList.cc

Mar 8th, 2017 A. Howard - B03-V10-03-01
- B03PhysicsList - removed obsolete unnececssary instantiation of
  de-excitation sub-models

Mar 7th, 2017 A. Howard - B03-V10-03-00
- Removed unnecessary clear sampling from B03

October 14th, 2016 G.Folger   - B03-V10-02-01
- remove direct use of theParticleIterator, use GetParticleTableIterator().
  fix required by clang39 on Linux and MAC

Jul 20th, 2016 I. Hrivnacova
- Coding guidelines (redundant empty lines)

Jan 27th, 2016 M. Asai - B03-V10-02-00
- B03PhysicsList.cc : change process order index of G4ParallelWorldProcess
  to 9900 to make sure it is registered prior to G4OpBoundaryProcess.

Jan 21st, 2015 M. Asai - B03-V10-01-00
- B03PhysicsList.cc : properly use SetProcessOrderingToSecond()
  method for G4ParallelWorldProcess.

Nov 20th, 2014 M. Asai - B03-V10-00-00
- B03PhysicsList.cc : replace obsolete G4ParallelWorldScoringProcess
  with G4ParallelWorldProcess.

Nov 24th, 2013 A. Howard - B03-V09-06-04
- Set default number of MT cores back to two

Nov 24th, 2013 A. Howard - B03-V09-06-03
- Synchronised geometry with B01 and B02
- Corrected english mistakes in variable names

Nov 23rd, 2013 A. Howard - B03-V09-06-02
- Prevented case of double biasing process in single threaded mode
- Removed unsused scoring classes B03ScoringDetectorConstruction,
  B03PSScoringDetectorConstruction

Nov 22nd, 2013 A. Howard - B03-V09-06-01
- Fixed typos and removed unused variables

Nov 22nd, 2013 A. Howard - B03-V09-06-00
- Created new example. This is taken from the previous B02 which was migrated
  to the new MT compliant interface using modular physicslists.
- Contains standalone physicslist implementation to demonstrate new MT
  compliance
