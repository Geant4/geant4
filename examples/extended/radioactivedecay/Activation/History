# Example Activation History

See `CONTRIBUTING.rst` for details of **required** info/format for each entry,
which **must** added in reverse chronological order (newest at the top). It must **not**
be used as a substitute for writing good git commit messages!

19-07-21 I. Hrivnacova (activation-V10-07-06)
- Updated for changes in the analysis category:
  removed deleting of the analysis manager,
  as this is now done by the Geant4 kernel.

22-06-21 G. Cosmo (activation-V10-07-05)
- Use new CLHEP units for minute, hour, day, year and millielectronvolt
  in PhysicsList.

15-04-21 mma (activation-V10-07-04)
- Activation.cc: RunManagerFactory
                 G4SteppingVerboseWithUnits
	         ParticleHP env variables 
- ActionInitialization.hh and cc: remove SteppingVerbose class

04-03-21 A. Ribon (activation-V10-07-03)

  G4PhotoNuclearProcess (that has been deleted) with
  G4HadronInelasticProcess.

- README : add macros description

05-08-20 Alberto Ribon  (activation-V10-06-02)
- envHadronic.(c)sh : removed deprecated HP environmental variables
  and replaced them with corresponding C++ calls in the main.
  (These two shell-script files will be removed in G4 11.0.)
     
21-06-20 mma (activation-V10-06-01)

07-10-18 mma (activation-V10-04-04)
- PhysicsList : use G4IonElasticPhysics and G4IonPhysicsXS

25-06-18 mma (activation-V10-04-03)
- envHadronic : add env variables for particleHP (PHP)

08-05-18 Ben Morgan (activation-V10-04-02)
- Include G4Types before use of G4MULTITHREADED. For forward
  compatibility with move to #defines over -D for G4 preprocessor
  symbols.

06-04-18 mma (activation-V10-04-01)
- Activation.cc : set visualisation only in interactive mode

15-03-18 mma (activation-V10-04-00)
- Activation.cc : remove G4UI_USE and G4VIS_USE

28-11-17 Ivana Hrivnacova (activation-V10-03-05)
- Fixed Doxygen warnings

25-10-17 Ivana Hrivnacova (activation-V10-03-03,04)
- Reverted back the example name; 
  (it's not possible to tag the renamed example)
- Minor modifications in  readme only

19-10-17 Ivana Hrivnacova (activation-V10-03-02)
- Renamed example from Activation in activation

17-10-17 mma (activation-V10-03-01)
- update readme

16-05-17 mma (activation-V10-03-00)
- first tag. Cowork with ctests-V10-03-07

21-04-17 Ivana Hrivnacova
- Make the Run::fIonMap, fIonId static and added lock in Run::GetIonId()
  where these data are updated. This makes the code working in MT mode. 
- Simplified code in Run class:
  - Introduced C++11 range for-loops
  - Added a private function for merging particle data maps to avoid code duplication

07-02-17 Michel Maire
- created from Hadr06
