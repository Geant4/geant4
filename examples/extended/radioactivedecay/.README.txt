 Examples in this directory demonstrate the use of some features of the
 Radioactive-Decay hadronic model in Geant4.

 \link Examplerdecay01 rdecay01 \endlink 

 This example allows to display basic features of the radioactive decay
 of a nuclei: energy spectrum of emitted particles, time of life, activity.

 \link Examplerdecay02 rdecay02 \endlink 

 This example illustrates more advanced features of the package:
 selected decay channels, time window, bias and variance reduction technique.

 \link ExampleActivation Activation \endlink

 Compute and plot time evolution of each nuclide in an hadronic cascade.
 Compute and plot activity of emerging particles.
