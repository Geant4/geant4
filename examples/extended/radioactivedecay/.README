 Examples in this directory demonstrate the use of some features of the
 Radioactive-Decay hadronic model in Geant4.

 \link Examplerdecay01 rdecay01 \endlink 

 This example allows to display basic features of the radioactive decay
 of a nuclei: energy spectrum of emitted particles, time of life, activity.

 \link Examplerdecay02 rdecay02 \endlink 

 This example illustrates more advanced features of the package:
 selected decay channels, time window, bias and variance reduction technique.
