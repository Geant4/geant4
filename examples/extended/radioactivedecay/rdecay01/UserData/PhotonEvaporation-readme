
The photo-evaporation database contains nuclear deexcitation data starting 
from a given nuclear level including information on spin of a state and
angular moment of a transition in a directory

correlated_gamma of this dataset 
 
**************************************************

A file is divided into sublock, each representing a level of the isotope.
All levels included the ground state are listed.
Each sublock level start by a line defining the characteristic of the level.
Followed by lines defining the gamma transition from this level to lower levels.

The line defining an energy level of the isotope contains 6 columns:
1) An integer defining the order index of the level starting by 0  for the ground state

2) A string  defining floating level  (-,+X,+Y,+Z,+U,+V,+W,+R,+S,+T,+A,+B,+C)
   - string means that it is a non floating level.
       
3) Excitation energy of the level (keV)

4) Level half-life (s). A -1 half-life means a stable ground state.

5) JPi information of the level. The sign gives the parity. A value of 99 is used when the Jpi is 
   missing in the the ENSDF files.
        
6) n_gammas= Number of possible gammas deexcitation channel from the level.
    n_gammas=O means that no gamma deexcitation is given in ENSDF data for this level.

After the line defining a level, a serie of n_gammas lines defined the different
n_gammas gamma deexcitation.The information contains in a gamma line is the following:

1) The order number of the daughter level.

2) The energy of the gamma transition.

3) The relative gamma emission intensity. 

4) The multipolarity number with 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 representing E1,M1,E2,M2,E3,M3  monopole transition
   and  100*Nx+Ny representing multipolarity transition with Ny and Ny taking the value 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 
   referring to   E1,M1,E2,M2,E3,M3,.. For example a M1+E2 transition would be written 203.
  
 
5) The multipolarity mixing ratio. O means that either the transition is a E1,M1,E2,M2 transition 
   or the multipolarity mixing ratio is not given in ENSDF.
  
6) Total internal conversion coefficient : alpha = Ic/Ig
   Note1: total transition is the sum of gamma de-excitation and internal
          conversion. Therefore total branching ratio is proportional to 
          (1+alpha)*Ig
   Note2: total branching ratios from a given level do not always sum up to 
          100%. They are re-normalized internally.    
   Note3: relative probabilities for gamma de-excitation and internal conversion
          are 1/(1+alpha) and alpha/(1+alpha) respectively
7-16) Given only if total internal conversion coefficient alpha is not 0 
        Partial conversion probabilities for
                K-shell
                L1-3 shells
                M1-5 shells
                Outer shells (shellID = 9 is used, when applicable)
