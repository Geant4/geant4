                            --------
			    
 Survey G4RadioactiveDecay process. See Physics Reference Manual, chapter 36.
 See also http://ie.lbl.gov/decay.html
 	
 1- Geometry construction
    ---------------------

 It is a simple box which represente an 'infinite' homogeneous medium.
  
 2- Physics list
    ------------

 PhysicsList.cc defines only G4RadioactiveDecay, G4Transportation processes,
 and relevant particle definitions.
 Therefore, once created, particles or ions travel as geantino.
         	
 3- Primary generator
    -----------------
 
 Default kinematic is an ion (Ne24), at rest, at coordinate origin.
 Can be changed with particleGun commands.
         	
 4- Physics
    -------
 As said above, all particles and ions behave as geantino, eg. no energy loss.
     
 A flag, /rdecay01/fullChain (true or false), allows to limit to
 single decay or full decay chain (default). 
 In case of full decay chain, G4TrackStatus of ions is set to fStopButAlive
 in order to force decay at rest.   
 In case of single decay, G4TrackStatus of secondary ion is set to fStopAndKill.
   
 At each decay, one counts and plots energy spectrum of created particles and
 ions, and energy-momentum balance of that decay.
 
 Total time of life of decay chain is plotted. Activity is computed.
 
 The command /rdecay01/timeWindow allows to survey activity of each nuclide in a specified
 time window [t1,t2] : population at t1 and t2, nb of decays within [t1,t2], mean activity.
 See timeWindow.mac
 
 Few macros are given in example. Debug.mac is to be run in interactive mode. 
 
 4-a User data files
 -------------------
 Users can redefine RadioactiveDecay and PhotonEvaporation data, via commands:
 /grdm/setRadioactiveDecayFile
 /grdm/setPhotoEvaporationFile 
 Examples of such files are given in subdirectory UserData. 
 Formats are described in readme
 Examples in macros Cf238.mac and No252.mac
 
 4-b example of biasing
 ----------------------
 macro timeWindowBiased.mac illustrates one of the biasing capabilities of the 
 radioactiveDecay package. Ca47 is "forced" to decay within 20 days
 (eg. 1728000 seconds in data file).
 It is instructive to plot time of life (histo 8) with and without the weight of the track:
 see lines 189/190 of TrackingAction.cc
 And also to compare with analog decay mode : comment out /grdm/ commands in the macro. 
  	
 5- Visualisation
    -------------
 
 Visualization Manager is set in the main().
 Initialisation of the drawing is done via the commands
 /vis/.. in the macro vis.mac. This macro is automatically read from the main 
 in case of interactive running mode.

 6- How to start ?
    --------------
 
  - Execute rdecay01 in 'batch' mode from macro files
 	% rdecay01   singleDecay.mac
 		
  - Execute rdecay01 in 'interactive mode' with visualization
 	% rdecay01
 	....
 	Idle>   ---> type your commands. For instance:
	Idle> /control/execute debug.mac 
	....
	Idle> /run/beamOn 1
	....				
 	Idle> exit
	
 7- Histograms
    ----------
 
  rdecay01 produces several 1D histograms which are saved as
  rdecay01.root by default.

      1 : energy spectrum: e+ e-
      2 : energy spectrum: nu_e anti_nu_ev
      3 : energy spectrum: gamma
      4 : energy spectrum: alpha
      5 : energy spectrum: ions
      6 : total kinetic energy (Q)
      7 : momentum balance
      8 : total time of life of decay chain
      9 : total visible energy
                            
   The histograms are managed by G4AnalysisManager and its Messenger. 
   The histos can be individually activated with the command :
   /analysis/h1/set id nbBins  valMin valMax unit 
   where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, deg or mrad, etc..)
   
   One can control the name of the histograms file with the command:
   /analysis/setFileName  name  (default rdecay1)
   
   It is possible to choose the format of the histogram file : root (default),
   xml, csv, by using namespace in HistoManager.hh
   
   It is also possible to print selected histograms on an ascii file:
   /analysis/h1/setAscii id
   All selected histos will be written on a file name.ascii (default rdecay1)
