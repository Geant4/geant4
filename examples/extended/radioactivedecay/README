                Geant4 extended examples - radioactive decay
                --------------------------------------------

 Examples in this directory demonstrate the use of some features of the
 Radioactive-Decay hadronic model in Geant4.

rdecay01
--------

 This example allows to display basic features of the radioactive decay
 of a nuclei: energy spectrum of emitted particles, time of life, activity.

rdecay02
--------

 This example illustrates more advanced features of the package:
 selected decay channels, time window, bias and variance reduction technique.

Activation
----------

 Compute and plot time evolution of each nuclide in an hadronic cascade.
 Compute and plot activity of emerging particles.
