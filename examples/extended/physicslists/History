# Example physicslists History

See `CONTRIBUTING.rst` for details of **required** info/format for each entry,
which **must** added in reverse chronological order (newest at the top). It must **not**
be used as a substitute for writing good git commit messages!


## 2023-11-15 I. Hrivnacova (exPhysicsLists-V11-01-01)
- Updated vis.mac macros:
  - Changed "/vis/open XYZ [600x600-0+0]" to "/vis/open" to allow run-time choices
    and simplified comments.

## 2023-07-04 I. Hrivnacova (exPhysicsLists-V11-01-00)
-  Removed 'shared' directory from the physicslist top directory
   (Redundant since moving from svn to git)

## 2021-12-10 Ben Morgan (exPhysicsLists-V11-00-00)
- Change to new Markdown History format
