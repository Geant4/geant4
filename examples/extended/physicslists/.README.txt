 Examples in this directory demonstrate usage of Geant4 reference physics lists
 and physics builders.

\link Examplefactory factory \endlink

Demonstrates the usage of G4PhysListFactory to build  the concrete physics list

\link ExampleextensibleFactory extensibleFactory \endlink

 Demonstrates the usage of extensible g4alt::G4PhysListFactory to build a
 concrete physics list. It also demonstrates the setting of an alternative
 "default" physics list; extending existing lists by adding/replacing physics
 constructors; and extending the factory with user supplied physics lists.

\link ExamplegenericPL genericPL \endlink

 Demonstrates the usage of G4GenericPhysicsList to build  the concrete physics
 list at the run time.
