                Geant4 extended examples - physicslists
                ----------------------------------------

 Examples in this directory demonstrate usage of Geant4 reference physics lists
 and physics builders.

 factory
 --------

 Demonstrates the usage of G4PhysListFactory to build  the concrete physics list

 extensibleFactory
 -----------------

 Demonstrates the usage of extensible g4alt::G4PhysListFactory to build a
 concrete physics list.  It also demonstrates the setting of an alternative
 "default" physics list; extending existing lists by adding/replacing physics
 constructors; and extending the factory with user supplied physics lists.


 genericPL
 ---------

 Demonstrates the usage of G4GenericPhysicsList to build  the concrete physics
 list at the run time.
