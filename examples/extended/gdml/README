     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
     =========================================================

                          GDML read/write
                          ---------------

This example demonstrates the usage of the GDML reader and writer. It allows
to export geometry descriptions in an application independent format (GDML,
Geometry Description Markup Language).
The GDML files can be then used to interchange geometries between different
applications and users.

The detector construction consists of a call to GDMLProcessor which parses a
GDML file and returns the pointer to the world volume. The user can also write
her/his own GDML file and use it as the primary input format for her/his Geant4
application.

More than one simple GDML files are provided:
- axes.gdml, showing loading and orientation of Cartesian axes;
- diamond.gdml, a simple diamond structure made of tessellated solids;
- modular.gdml, the combination of the two GDML files above loaded as
  separate modules in the same setup.

HOW TO BUILD THE EXAMPLE ?

- You need to have built the persistency/gdml plugin module by having
  set G4LIB_BUILD_GDML variable in your environment.
  It is also required you specify the path where the XercesC XML parser
  package is installed in your system, through the variable XERCESCROOT.

- Compile and link to generate the executable:
 	      % gmake

- Execute the application:
 	      % load_gdml [GDML-file].gdml
  Note: if you are using dynamic libraries, you should add and
        $XERCESCROOT/lib paths to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH directory (or
        equivalent on your system).
