                           TBB/B2b
                           --------

This example shows how to integrate Intel Threading Building Block and Geant4 
to achieve event-level parallelism. 

Note that this is a preliminary version which should not be considered a 
feature-complete example and which presents some limitations (no merging of
output, no correct clean-up of heap). It will be substantially improved 
in 2014.

This example adds to B2b example, originally provided in basic example,
the TBB based classes:

tbbMasterRunManager:  
--------------------
This class implements the master model run manager for TBB bases
application.
It is instantiated by user main (or equivalent function) instead
of G4[MT]RunManager. It controls the creation of tbb::tasks.
See G4MTRunManager for documentation of methods relative to base
class. Only class specific methods are documented here.

tbbWorkerRunManager
--------------------
This class implements the worker model run manager for TBB based
application.
It is instantiated by tbbUserWorkerInitialization and used by
tbbMasterRunManager.
See G4WorkerRunManager for documentation of methods relative to
base class. Only class specific methods are documented here.
 
tbbUserWorkerInitialization
---------------------------
This class implements TBB specific worker initialization.
It is a sub-class of G4UserWorkerThreadInitialization.
Its role is to instantiate a tbbWorkerRunManager to be used by
tbb tasks. 

tbbTask
---------------------------
This class represents one TBB task.
