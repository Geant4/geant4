        Geant4 extended examples - TBB
        --------------------------------

TBB directory shows how to integrate Intel Threading Building Block and Geant4 
to achieve event-level parallelism. 

TBB/B2b

Currently only a preliminary version of one example is provided: it replaces 
the Geant4 Version 10.0 event-loop parallelism based on pthreads with TBB 
task-based parallelism. It should not be considered a feature-complete example 
and it present some limitations (no merging of output, no correct clean-up of 
heap). 

It will be substantially improved in the future.
If you have interest in TBB please 
refer to Geant4 Multi-threading user-forum (reachable from Geant4 website)
where updates on TBB will be communicated or contact example author at: 
adotti@slac.stanford.edu.
