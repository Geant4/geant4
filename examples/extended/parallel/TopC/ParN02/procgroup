# The general format is that "local 0" (required) implies creation of a master.
# Otherwise there is one line per slave.
# The first field is the hostname or localhost (in a form valid for "rsh")
#   If you prefer ssh over rsh, then (e.g. in csh):  setenv RSH ssh
# The second field, 1, is obligatory.
# The third field is an absolute or relative pathname (e.g.:  ./XXX or ../XXX)
#    of the binary.  A relative pathname is appended to path of the binary 
#    on master.  The slave process will execute in the same directory
#    as the current working directory of the master, if possible.
#    Otherwise, the slave will execute in the home directory.
# If the third field is `-', then the command line (including arguments)
#    for that slave will be the same as on the master.
# Any additional fields (fourth and beyond) are appended to the
#    command line for that slave only.
# Note that '>slave1.out' works, redirecting standard output.  However, 
#    the output file, slave1.out, will be placed in the home directory.
#    Currently, `localhost' implies the Bourne shell, and any other
#    name implies the default user shell for that machine.
#    By default, standard output and error are sent to user tty (a la rsh).
#
# The format is inherited from MPICH, which grew from P4.

#=========================================================================
#EXAMPLE:
# # Master process
# local 0
# # One slave process on local computer, using same binary and same arguments
# localhost 1 -
# # One remote slave process, with absolute path to binary and no arguments
# regulus.ccs.neu.edu 1 /ccs/tmp/gene/a.out
# # One slave using alpha architecture,
# #      with path of alpha binary relative to binary of this master process.
# #      Output placed in slave-alpha-1.out in user's home directory.
# alpha.ccs.neu.edu 1 ../alpha/a.out > slave-alpha-1.out

#=========================================================================
#IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:
# MPINU uses "rsh" to start a slave process.  Diagnose it via:
#   rsh REMOTE_SLAVE_HOST hostname
# If it doesn't work or if it asks you for a password, try:
#   1.  Add a .rhosts file on the remote host and specify your local host.
#   2.  Sometimes adding  .localhost  to your .rhosts helps.
#   3.  Specify an alternative to "rsh" in your shell.  For example:
#       RSH=ssh; export RSH  # in Bourne shell, bash, etc.
#       setenv RSH ssh       # in csh, tcsh, etc.
#   4.  If you use "ssh", you may also need to copy keys to allow
#       login to the remote host without a password.
# It's also possible that mpinu guessed badly the hostname of your local host.
# If you suspect this, on the master try (in csh, tcsh):
#   setenv CALLBACK_HOST LOCAL_MASTER_HOST
#   where LOCAL_MASTER_HOST is the correct hostname of the local master.
