              (event-level parallelism)

For the latest information on ParGeant4, see:
  http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/gene/pargeant4.html
Note that a version now exists that runs Geant4 over the Grid.
Please write to gene@ccs.neu.edu for further information.
To port other applications to a parallel version, read the
  files ../../info/PAR_INSTALL and ../../info/PAR_README.

See the beginning of GNUmakefile for reasonable `make' targets to run it.
To run it:
0.  a. Follow the standard Geant4 installation procedure.
    b. Download and install TOP-C
       The TOP-C home page is at http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/gene/topc.html
        cd <TOPC_INSTALL_DIR>
        gzip -dc topc.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
        cd topc
	./configure
	make
	make check
	[ Copy bin/topc-config to your path ]
    c. Verify that the Geant4 example installs:
        cd $G4INSTALL/examples/extended/parallel/ParN02
	make
	$G4WORKDIR/bin/$G4SYSTEM/ParN02 ParN02.in
2.  make run
    [ By default, the included `procgroup' file creates two slave processes
      on localhost. ]
    [ Note that in addition to output on master,
      $G4WORKDIR/bin/$G4SYSTEM/slave*.out contains slave output. ]
    [ To remove intermediate files and start over:  make parclean  ]
3.  Try running it with slave processes on remote processes.
    First, test that your local environment is set up correctly.
    Try:
    ssh <REMOTE_HOSTNAME> $G4WORKDIR/bin/$G4SYSTEM/ParN02 `pwd`/ParN02.in
    The above command needs to work without asking for a password.
    [ If you use dynamic libraries (*.so), make sure the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      in your shell startup file (e.g. ~.tcshrc) includes both:
      $G4INSTALL/lib/$G4SYSTEM and $CLHEP_BASE_DIR/lib
      If you use AFS, you may need to type 'klog' to renew your AFS token. ]
    In `procgroup' file, replace `localhost' by desired remote hosts;
    Add additional remote hosts (additional slaves) if you like.  
    Then:  make run 

============================================================================
If you read ParGNUmakefile, you'll find other things that you can
modify.  For example, all TOP-C additions are in conditionals:
  remove -DG4USE_TOPC from ParGNUmakefile and:
  make parclean; make run
  in order to re-compile and rerun without TOP-C.
Define REMOTE_SHELL differently if you don't use `ssh' for a remote shell.
  (If undefined, ParGNUmakefile defines it to be `ssh')
Define MACROFILE diferently to use a different set of input commands.
Define MEM_MODEL=--seq
  to run with TOP-C, but using a single (sequential) process, suitable
  for easy debugging (via gdb, for example).
Try:  pushd $G4WORKDIR/bin/$G4SYSTEM/; ./ParN02 --TOPC-help
  to see TOP-C run-time options that can be invoked, such as
    pushd $G4WORKDIR/bin/$G4SYSTEM/; ./ParN02 --TOPC-num-slaves=5 ParN02.in
  Alternatively, modify TOPC_OPTIONS in ParGNUmakefile for the same effect.

You can also try other targets:  make run-debug
  This will run it under gdb, so you can single step to see what happens.
make parclean - Start over with clean set of files.

============================================================================
New or modified files:
  ParN02.cc -     Adds one line:  #include "ParN02.icc"
		  ParExample.icc inserts:  #include "topc.h"
		  and causes main to calls TOPC_init, TOPC_finalize,
                  and to use: `new ParRunManager' instead of `new G4RunManager'
  GNUmakefile   - Adds one line at beginning:  include ParGNUmakefile
		  ParGNUmakefile defines EXTRALIBS and CPPFLAGS so as to
		    modify behavior of config/binmake.gmk
		    in order to use TOP-C libraries and includes
  procgroup     - Specifies which slave hosts to use, and where to put output
		  For example:  localhost 1 - > slave1.out
                                host=`localhost', executable=`same as master',
                                params of slave=`> slave1.out' (redirect output)
                  If output not redirected, it goes to stdout on master.
  src/ParRunManager.cc - ParRunManger derived from G4RunManager
		  replaces Gr4RunManager::DoEventLoop w/ TOP-C parallel loop,
                  Adds certain local vars of DoEventLoop as ParRunManager members
  include/MarshaledObj.h - run-time utilities for marshalling
  include/MarshaledEx*Hit.h - marshals N02 hits (calorimeter hits)
  include/MarshaledG4*.h - marshaling routines for Geant4 data structures

  ~/slave*.out	- Contains outputs of slave1, slave2, etc.
                  Generated each time parallel ParN02 is executed.
                  These files are specified in the file procgroup.

====================================================================
This version passes an event number to the slave and lets the
slave generate the event.  The slave passes back marshaled hits to
the master.

I will integrate the track level parallelism into this scenario at
a later date.  For the track level, I will generate several
secondary tracks on the master, and then convert the secondary tracks
to new events that can be passed to slaves.  I will do this only if
I detect that there are not enough initial events to fully occupy all
the slaves.  This scheme has the drawback that we are splitting an event
into many events, which may make the summarization, histogram, and so
on more difficult.  However, track level parallelism will be triggered
only when a very small number of events are generated.

I also want to support postponing
a track to the next event ( G4ClassificationOfNewTrack::fPostpone .
To do this, each slave will wait to retire an event until it knows that
the previous event has been retired.

In addition, I plan to have only the master read commands and pass
them to the slaves.  Currently, the master and slaves each read
identical commands.

====================================================================
If you are curious about some of the layers, the following
stack trace [somewhat out of date now] gives some idea.
   G4RunManager::BeamOn calls ParRunManager::DoEventLoop
(since G4RunManager::DoEventLoop is virtual)
  ParRunManager::DoEventLoop calls TOPC_master_slave
  TOPC_master_slave calls submit_task_input
  submit_task_input eventually calls COMM_send_msg which calls MPI_Send
(COMM_send_msg is the communication layer of TOPC;
 ParN02.cc was linked with the TOP-C MPI communication layer.
 The same source could have been linked with a POSIX threads layer,
 a communication layer, or some other communication layer.
)
  MPI_send calls send
(where send is the socket system call of libc.so)
