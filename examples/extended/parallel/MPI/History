18 May 2010 K.Murakami (MPI-V09-03-00)
 == code review was performed. ==
 << mpi_ineterface >>
 - OpenMPI as default MPI library instead of LAM/MPI
 - improve /mpi/status command. (waste of CPU, time measurement)
 - /mpi/wait command is introduced for waiting until beamOn ends.
 - improve macro file parser
    * same parser as G4UIbatch
    * fixed unexpected behavior at the end of batch mode
 - changed "beamOn" behavior for better performance
    * thread-out for interactive, on-thread for batch
 << exMPI01 >>
 - use G4UIcsh instead of G4UItcsh because OpenMPI is now default. 
 - use G4eMultipleScattering instead of obsolete G4MultipleScattering.
 << exMPI02 >>
 - use G4UIcsh instead of G4UItcsh because OpenMPI is now default.

16 Nov. 2007 K.Murakami
 - commited to G4 CVS.
