- Fixed shadowing warnings in G4atomic.hh header.

6/6/2018 Jonathan Madsen (ThreadsafeScorers-V10-04-02)
- TSPhysicsLists no longer declares G4VPhysicsConstructors in header

- Added TiMemory ASCII output and serialization to ts_scorers.cc

10/05/2018 Ben Morban (ThreadsafeScorers-V10-04-01)
- Include G4Types before use of G4MULTITHREADED. For forward

- Renamed all data members with f + uppercase
- Redeclared all virtual functions
- Removed empty messenger classes
- Removed custom separators with G4 separators
- Added license and description for all classes
