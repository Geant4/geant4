- Added TiMemory ASCII output and serialization to ts_scorers.cc

10/05/2018 Ben Morban (ThreadsafeScorers-V10-04-01)
- Include G4Types before use of G4MULTITHREADED. For forward

- Correct GNUmakefile,i.e. replace spaces by tab

17/11/15 J. Madsen
- Removed preprocessor checks for C++11
- Removed _HAS_ATOMICS_ preprocessor definition/conditions
- Changed G4atomic to only be defined if G4MULTITHREADED,
