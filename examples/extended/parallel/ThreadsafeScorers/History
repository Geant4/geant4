# History entries prior to 11.0

13/02/2021 V. Ivantchenko (ThreadsafeScorers-V10-07-00)
- TSPhysicsList - removed obsolete header G4EmProcessOptions; removed
  method SetCuts(..) to avoid data race - use the one from the base class; 
  removed singletone pattern from this class - it is not used and not needed. 

12/11/2020 Jonathan Madsen (ThreadsafeScorers-V10-06-03)
- Replaced TIMEMORY_AUTO_TIMER usage with G4USER_SCOPED_PROFILE usage

23/6/2020 Jonathan Madsen (ThreadsafeScores-V10-06-02)
- Added example of user code leveraging tasking in TSRunAction.cc
- This example leverages tasks on the master thread at the end
  of the run to generate some strings of output via a nested
  hierarchy of tasks and uses the features of the
  G4TaskGroup to combine the strings in the order that
  they were submitted to the task-group (thus producing the
  same output result as the serial version)

23/6/2020 Gabriele Cosmo (ThreadsafeScorers-V10-06-01)
- Properly include G4RunManagerFactory.hh in main().

28/5/2020 Jonathan Madsen (ThreadsafeScorers-V10-06-00)
- Updated to use tasking system

22/11/2019 Jonathan Madsen (ThreadsafeScorers-V10-05-01)
- Updated CMakeLists.txt to support enabling timemory even without
  support at the Geant4 level

19/11/2019 Gabriele Cosmo (ThreadsafeScorers-V10-05-00)
- Fixed compilation warning on Windows for calling TIMEMORY_AUTO_TIMER
  with no arguments in TSPrimaryGeneratorAction::GeneratePrimaries().
