This example is based on extended/electromagnetic/TestEm3 and
demonstrates how to register specialized tracking managers for
a particle or a set of particles.

1- Geometry definition

   The geometry of a simplified sampling calorimeter is used as
   in TestEm3, please refer to its documentation for more details.
   The same UI commands exist for modifying the geometry (number
   of layers and absorbers, material and its thickness), without
   the /testem/ prefix.

   In addition to the definition of the volumes, this example adds
   two regions, "Front" and "Back", which contain the front and
   rear half of the calorimeter.

2- Physics lists

   By default, the example uses G4EmStandardPhysics and registers
   processes to the G4ProcessManager. This can be changed with the
   /setMode UI command. Possible values are:

   processes:   use G4EmStandardPhysics, the default
   tracking:    use the same physics as G4EmStandardPhysics, but
                implemented as a specialized tracking manager for
                electrons, positrons, and gammas; see the file
                EmStandardPhysicsTrackingManager.cc for details.
   specialized: use a specialized tracking manager for gammas; for
                the purpose of demonstration,
                - it uses G4EmStandardPhysics as the basis,
                - defers processing of gammas with a kinetic energy
                  of more than 100 MeV,
                - implement a specialized stepping loop for the
                  "Back" region of the detector.
                See the file SpecializedTrackingManager.cc for more
                details on the exact implementation.

3- How to start?

   This example comes with one macro file for each of the described
   modes that can be passed as a parameter to the executable:
