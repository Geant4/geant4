/*! \page ExampleRE07 Example RE07

This example is based on extended/electromagnetic/TestEm3 and
demonstrates how to register specialized tracking managers for
a particle or a set of particles.

\section RE07_s1 Geometry definition

The geometry of a simplified sampling calorimeter is used as
in \link ExampleTestEm3 TestEm3 \endlink, please refer to its
documentation for more details.
The same UI commands exist for modifying the geometry (number
of layers and absorbers, material and its thickness), without
the /testem/ prefix.

In addition to the definition of the volumes, this example adds
two regions, "Front" and "Back", which contain the front and
rear half of the calorimeter.

\section RE07_s2 Physics lists

By default, the example uses G4EmStandardPhysics and registers
processes to the G4ProcessManager. This can be changed with the
/setMode UI command. Possible values are:

- processes:   use G4EmStandardPhysics, the default
- tracking:    use the same physics as G4EmStandardPhysics, but
               implemented as a specialized tracking manager for
               electrons, positrons, and gammas; see the file
               EmStandardPhysicsTrackingManager.cc for details.
- specialized: use a specialized tracking manager for gammas; for
               the purpose of demonstration,
               - it uses G4EmStandardPhysics as the basis,
               - defers processing of gammas with a kinetic energy
                 of more than 100 MeV,
               - implement a specialized stepping loop for the
                 "Back" region of the detector.
               See the file SpecializedTrackingManager.cc for more
               details on the exact implementation.

\section RE07_s3 How to start?

This example comes with one macro file for each of the described
modes that can be passed as a parameter to the executable:
