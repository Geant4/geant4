You are using the RE02PhysicsList
This PhysicsList originally comes from 
example/extended/analysis/A01, and is modified 
in Hadron Physics in order to involve Binary Cascade
at low energy region and inelastic process for generic ions. 
Full set of particles (barions bosons and mesons) will be created and
Standard EM Physics and Low & High Energy parameterized models will be applied.
RE02PhysicsList is optimized for robustness
and not for any particular usage.
For the hadronic physics, educated guesses of physics list are prepared for various use cases.
When you will start REAL calculations for your own interest,
please consider the usage of hadronic_lists instead of RE02PhysicsLists.
More information can also be found from the Geant4 HyperNews.
