/*! \page ExampleRE05 Example RE05

 Example RE05 has a simplified collider detector geometry. This example
demonstrates the following features. \n
 It was moved in extended examples from novice/N04 with removal of
novice examples. 

\section RE05_s1 PYTHIA primary events

 RE05PrimaryGeneratorAction has G4HEPEvtInterface as the generator.
G4HEPEvtInterface accesses to "pythia_event.data", which contains three
events of Higgs generation produced by PYTHIA. "pythia_main.f" is an
example FORTRAN code of PYTHIA for generating this event sample.

\section RE05_s2 Readout geometry

 RE05DetectorConstruction defines a simplified collider detecor
geometry, a tracker made of cylindrical tubes, a calorimeter made of
cylindrical tubes, and muon trackers made of planes.

 The cylindrical calorimeter is made of tubes of lead and a scintillator.
Energy deposition in the scintillator is accumulated by RE05CalorimeterSD 
sensitive detector, which is assigned to a dedicated parallel world,
RE05CalorimeterParallelWorld, which defines the phi-z cell.

\section RE05_s3 Physics processes

 The example uses the QBBC physics list, which includes electromagnetic 
and hadronic interactions. 

\section RE05_s4 Event filtering by the stacking mechanism

 Higgs events in "pythia_event.data" have two lepton pairs produced
by the Higgs decay via Z0. At the first stage of each event, only the
primary muons are tracked without tracking secondaries. then the number
of hits on the muon trackers are examined. At the next stage, only
the primary charged particles are tracked only inside the barrel
tracking area and the isolation of the primary muons are examined.
At the third stage, all particles in the RoI (Region of Interest) along
the isolated muons are tracked. All these examinations are applied in
RE05StackingAction.
