\section RE03_s1 Introduction

 This example demonstrates how to use UI-command base scoring.
It create parallel world(s) for defining scoring mesh(es).

 Due to some performance overhead, this functionality is not 
provided by default. To get it included, the pointer to 
G4ScoringManager must be accessed. The access to the static 
method G4ScoringManager::GetScoringManager() activates this 
functionality. 

\subsection RE03_s11 Geometry and primary particle

 It has just one water box in the world volume filled by air.
No detector in the mass geometry. Particle gun shoots a gamma
into the water box.

\subsection RE03_s12 Physics

 The physics list is taken from referenced physics-list QGS_BIC
in Geant4.

\section RE03_s2 Macro files

 "run1.mac" through "run4.mac" macro files should be used 
independently. Each macro file create its own scoring parallel
world(s). "vis.mac", "drawSlices.mac" and "drawCylinderSlices.mac" 
are used internally. Each macro should work for both interactively 
and batch, but interactive mode is advised for better visualization.

 IMPORTANT: DO NOT use more than one of these macro files in one
execution of this example.

\section RE03_s3 RE03UserScoreWriter

 G4ScoringManager has a default score writer which dumps every
entry of one quantity of a mesh for all quantities of the mesh
one by one in CSV format. To alternate the file format the user
can implement his/her own score writer deriving from G4VUserScoreWriter
base class and set it to G4ScoringManager. To demonstrate this,
RE03UserScoreWriter is included in this example. To use this
alternative writer, un-comment its instantiation in RE03.cc.
