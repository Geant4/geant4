/*! \page ExampleuserPrimaryGenerator Example userPrimaryGenerator

 The example shows how to create a primary event including several vertices and 
 several primary particles per vertex

  \section userPrimaryGenerator_s1 Geometry construction

 It is a simple box which represents an 'infinite' homogeneous medium.
  
  \section userPrimaryGenerator_s2 Physics list

 PhysicsList.cc defines only geantino and transportation process.

  \section userPrimaryGenerator_s3 Primary generator : several vertices and particles per event

 vertex A and particle 1 : a geantino uniformly randomized on a cylinder surface.
 vertex B and particles 2 and 3 : symetric to vertex A.

  \section userPrimaryGenerator_s4 Visualisation

 Visualization Manager is set in the main().
 Initialisation of the drawing is done via the commands
 /vis/.. in the macro vis.mac. This macro is automatically read from the main 
 in case of interactive running mode.

  \section userPrimaryGenerator_s5 How to start ?

  - execute userPrimaryGenerator in 'batch' mode from macro files
\verbatim  
	% userPrimaryGenerator   run1.mac
\endverbatim

  - execute userPrimaryGenerator in 'interactive mode' with visualization
\verbatim  
	% userPrimaryGenerator
	....
	Idle>      ---> type your commands. For instance:
	Idle> /run/beamOn 1
	....
	Idle> exit
\endverbatim
