        Geant4 extended examples - event generator
        -------------------------------------------

 Examples in this directory demonstrate various ways of primary event
 generation.

particleGun
------------

This example demonstrate 4 ways of the usage of G4ParticleGun shooting
primary particles in different cases.

exgps
-----

This example demonstrates the usage of G4GeneralParticleSource for generating 
primary incident particle according to user defined distributions.

userPrimaryGenerator
--------------------

This example shows how to create a primary event including several vertices and 
several primary particles per vertex.

HepMC
------

This directory contains examples for using HepMC as an interface with 
various Monte Carlo event generators, such as PYTHIA.
It also include an example for demonstrating MC truth handling with HepMC. 

pythia
------

This directory contains examples for using Pythia as Monte Carlo event
generator, interfaced with Geant4, and showing how to implement an external
decayer.
