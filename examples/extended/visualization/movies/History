# Example movies History

See `CONTRIBUTING.rst` for details of **required** info/format for each entry,
which **must** added in reverse chronological order (newest at the top). It must **not**
be used as a substitute for writing good git commit messages!


## 2023-11-15 I. Hrivnacova (exam-ext-vis-movies-V11-01-02)
- Updated vis.mac macros:
  - Changed "/vis/open XYZ [600x600-0+0]" to "/vis/open" to allow run-time choices
    and simplified comments.

## 2023-11-07 I. Hrivnacova (exam-ext-vis-movies-V11-01-01)
- Fixed formatting in .README.txt

## 2023-10-20 John Allison (exam-ext-vis-movies-V11-01-00)
- vis.mac: Remove defunct command /vis/ogl/set/displayListLimit.
  - This command no longer operates. There is now no display list limit.
    (The only limit is available memory.)
  - The command is deprecated and, anyway, causes a crash if the app is built
    without an OpenGL driver.

## 2022-11-04  I. Hrivnacova (exam-ext-vis-movies-V11-00-01)
- Fixed Doxygen file descriptions (mostly missing)
- Fixed formatting in .README.txt

## 2021-12-10 Ben Morgan (exam-ext-vis-movies-V11-00-00)
- Change to new Markdown History format
