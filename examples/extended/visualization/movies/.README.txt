This example illustrates how to create a movie.

See https://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/UsersGuides/ForApplicationDeveloper/html/Visualization/makingamovie.html#.

A) USING `/vis/viewer/save` AND `/vis/viewer/interpolate`
=========================================================

1. a. To see a pre-prepared example, start this example in interactive mode
      (i.e., without any command line arguments). Just type

            /vis/viewer/interpolate viewfiles/movie-1

      If you want to see an electromagnetic shower

            /run/beamOn
            /vis/viewer/interpolate viewfiles/movie-1

   b. To make your own movie, save a sequence of views with

            /vis/viewer/save

      Then "fly through" with

            /vis/viewer/interpolate".

      The procedure is: choose a view, save, choose another view, save, and
      so on until you have, say, 10 saved views. Then you may

            /vis/viewer/interpolate

      Note: This saves views to your current working directory. It is
      always good to remove any pre-existing saved files:

            rm *.g4view

      or save them, e.g.

            mkdir views
            mv *.g4view views

      which can subsequently be interpolated with

            /vis/viewer/interpolate views

   c. Then you have a choice of how to export the movie - see 3 below.

2. You can use time-slicing to see particles progress through time

   a. To see a pre-prepared example

         /vis/modeling/trajectories/drawByCharge-0/default/setTimeSliceInterval 0.01 ns
         /run/beamOn
         /vis/viewer/interpolate viewfiles/movie-2

   b. To make your own movie

         /vis/scene/add/trajectories rich
         /vis/modeling/trajectories/drawByCharge-0/default/setTimeSliceInterval 0.01 ns
         # Optionally add features (see guidance on /vis/viewer/set/timeWindow/)
         /vis/viewer/set/timeWindow/displayLightFront true 0 0 -20 cm -0.01 ns
         /vis/viewer/set/timeWindow/displayHeadTime true
         /vis/viewer/set/timeWindow/fadeFactor 1
         /run/beamOn
         # Then set a time window and save
         /vis/viewer/set/timeWindow/startTime 0 ns .1 ns
         /vis/viewer/save
         # Then zoom, pan etc to a view of interest
         # Then set the next time window and save
         /vis/viewer/set/timeWindow/startTime .5 ns .1 ns
         /vis/viewer/save
         # Then zoom, pan etc to a view of interest
         # Then set the next time window and save
         /vis/viewer/set/timeWindow/startTime 1 ns .1 ns
         /vis/viewer/save
         # Then another view, the next time window, and a save...
         # ...repeat a few more times
         # Then try
         /vis/viewer/interpolate

3. How to export images using /vis/viewer/interpolate (OpenGL only)

         /vis/viewer/interpolate ! ! ! ! export

   This produces lots of files.
   You can change export format with (for example)

         /vis/ogl/set/exportFormat jpg

   Then import them into your favourite movie maker - see
   https://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/UsersGuides/ForApplicationDeveloper/html/Visualization/makingamovie.html#

B) THE OLD WAY
==============

These files are inherited from the old "novice" example N03. They draw (and
optionally, save) views using a macro loop. They have not been tested
recently. Best to run in batch mode in the build directory. E.g.

    ./movies -m visTutor/exN03Vis12.mac
    ./movies -m visTutor/exN03Vis13.mac
