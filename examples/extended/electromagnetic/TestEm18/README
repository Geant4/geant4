                            TestEm18
                            --------
    This example allows to study the various contributions of the energy lost 
    by a charged particle in a single layer of an homogeneous material.
    See any textbook of interactions of charged particles with matter, in particular :
      1- geant4.web.cern.ch --> UserSupport --> Physics Reference Manual
      2- lappweb.in2p3.fr/~maire/tutorials/index.html
	
 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
    It is a simple cubic box of homogeneous material.
    Two parameters define the geometry :
 	- the material of the box,
	- the thickness of the box.
 	
    The default geometry (1 cm of water) is constructed in DetectorConstruction,
    but the above parameters can be changed interactively via the commands
    defined in DetectorMessenger.
 	
 2- PHYSICS
 
    The physics list contains the 'standard' electromagnetic processes.
    However the MultipleScattering is not registered, in order to focuse on
    fluctuations of to energy loss alone.
	 	 
 3- BEAM
 
    The primary kinematic is a single particle starting at the edge
    of the box. The type of the particle and its energy are set in 
    PrimaryGeneratorAction (e- 10 MeV), and can be changed via the G4 
    build-in commands of ParticleGun class.
 	
 4- RUN
 
    During the tracking of the incident particle, by default, the secondary 
    particles are immediately killed, after that their energy has been registered
    (see SteppingAction and StackingAction).
    Therefore, we study here the various components of the total energy lost
    by the incident particle, not the energy deposited in a layer of finite
    thickness.
    With the option /testEm/trackSecondaries one can compute and plot the energy
    deposited in the layer. See edep.mac
    
    At EndOfRun, the above results are compared with 'reference' values,
    i.e. the input data read from EnergyLoss and Range tables.
    See reference 2 : Energy-Range relation, slide 4.

 5- HISTOGRAMS
         
    The test contains 13 built-in 1D histograms, which are managed by
    G4AnalysisManager and its Messenger.

           1  step size of primary track
           2  energy continuously deposited along primary track
           3  energy transfered to secondaries by ionisation
           4  energy transfered to secondaries by Bremsstrahlung
           5  energy transfered to secondaries by (e+,e-) production
           6  total energy transfered to secondaries
           7  total energy lost by primary track
           8  total energy lost by primary track from energy balance
           9  energy continuously deposited along secondary tracks
          10  total energy deposited
          11  energy spectrum of gamma
          12  energy spectrum of e-
          13  energy spectrum of e+

    The histograms are defined in HistoManager.
     	
    The histos can be activated individually with the command :
    /analysis/h1/set id nbBins valMin valMax unit
    where 'unit' is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or KeV, cm or mm, etc..)
								  
    One can control the name of the histograms file with the command:
    /analysis/setFileName  name  (default testem18)
   
    It is possible to choose the format of the histogram file : root (default),
    xml, csv, by using namespace in HistoManager.hh 	
   
    It is also possible to print selected histograms on an ascii file:
    /analysis/h1/setAscii id
    All selected histos will be written on a file name.ascii  (default testem18)
 	 				
 6- VISUALIZATION
 
    The Visualization Manager is set in the main().
    The initialisation of the drawing is done via the commands
    /vis/... in the macro vis.mac. To get visualisation:
    > /control/execute vis.mac
 	
    The detector has a default view which is a longitudinal view of the box.
    The tracks are drawn at the end of event, and erased at the end of run.
	
 7- HOW TO START ?
 
    execute TestEm18 in 'batch' mode from macro files :
 	% TestEm18   electron.mac
 		
    execute TestEm18 in 'interactive mode' with visualization :
 	% TestEm18
	Idle> control/execute vis.mac
 	....
 	Idle> type your commands
 	....
 	Idle> exit
