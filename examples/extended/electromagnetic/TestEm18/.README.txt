 This example allows to study the energy lost by a charged particle in a
 single layer, due to ionization and bremsstrahlung. Results are compared to
 'reference' values.
	
\section TestEm18_s1 GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
 It is a single box of homogeneous medium.
 Two parameters define the geometry :
     - the material of the box,
     - the (full) size of the box.
 
 The default geometry (1 cm of water) is constructed in DetectorConstruction,
 but the above parameters can be changed interactively via the commands
 defined in DetectorMessenger.
 	
\section TestEm18_s2 PHYSICS
 
 The physics list, PhysicsList, contains the 'standard' electromagnetic processes.
 However the MultipleScattering is not registered, in order to focuse on
 fluctuations due to energy loss alone.
	 	 
\section TestEm18_s3 BEAM
 
 The primary kinematic is a single particle starting at the edge
 of the box. The type of the particle and its energy are set in 
 PrimaryGeneratorAction (e- 10 MeV), and can be changed via the G4 
 build-in commands of G4ParticleGun class.
 	
\section TestEm18_s4 RUN
 
 During the tracking of the incident particle, the secondary particles 
 are immediately killed, after that their energy has been registered
 (see StackingAction).
 Therefore, we study here the total energy lost by the incident particle,
 not the energy deposited in a layer of finite thickness.
 
 At RunAction::EndOfRunAction(), the above results are compared with 'reference' values,
 i.e. the values read from EnergyLoss tables.

\section TestEm18_s5 HISTOGRAMS
         
 The test contains 6 built-in 1D histograms, which are managed by
 G4AnalysisManager and its messenger.
 
 - 1 :  continuous energy loss along primary track
 - 2 :  energy from secondaries
 - 3 :  total energy lost by primary track (1+2)
 - 4 :  energy spectrum of e-+
 - 5 :  energy spectrum of gamma
 - 6 :  step size of primary track
      
 The histograms are defined in HistoManager.
     
 The histos can be activated individually with the command :
\verbatim
/analysis/h1/set id nbBins valMin valMax unit
\endverbatim
 where 'unit' is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or KeV, cm or mm, etc..)
								  
 One can control the name of the histograms file with the command:
\verbatim
/analysis/setFileName  name  (default testem18)
\endverbatim
 
 It is possible to choose the format of the histogram file : root (default),
 xml, csv, by using namespace in HistoManager.hh     
 
 It is also possible to print selected histograms on an ascii file:
\verbatim
/analysis/h1/sweAscii id
\endverbatim
 All selected histos will be written on a file name.ascii  (default testem18)
 	 				
\section TestEm18_s6 VISUALIZATION
 
 The Visualization Manager is set in the main () (see TestEm18.cc).
 The initialisation of the drawing is done via the commands
 /vis/... in the macro vis.mac. To get visualisation:
\verbatim
> /control/execute vis.mac
\endverbatim
 	
 The detector has a default view which is a longitudinal view of the box.
 The tracks are drawn at the end of event, and erased at the end of run.
	
\section TestEm18_s7 HOW TO START ?
 
 - Execute TestEm18 in 'batch' mode from macro files :
\verbatim
% TestEm18   electron.mac
\endverbatim
 		
 - Execute TestEm18 in 'interactive mode' with visualization :
\verbatim
% TestEm18
Idle> control/execute vis.mac
....
Idle> type your commands
....
Idle> exit
\endverbatim
