   How to do shower profiles in an homogenous medium, with virtual
   voxelisation.

\section TestEm2_s1 GEOMETRY DEFINITION

   The geometry consists of a cylinder of homegenous material.

   The default geometry is constructed in DetectorConstruction class,
   but all of the above parameters can be modified interactively via
   the commands defined in the DetectorMessenger class.

   Material can be choosen: Air Water lAr Al Fe BGO PbWO4 Pb.
   eg: 
\verbatim
/testem/det/setMat PbWO4
\endverbatim
   
   The cylinder is virtually sliced longitudinaly (slice) and radialy (ring).
   The size of the slices and rings are expressed in radiation length units
   and can be changed.
   eg: 
\verbatim
/testem/det/setLbin 20   1.    ---> 20 slices of 1. radl
/testem/det/setRbin  5   0.25  --->  5 rings of 0.25 radl
/testem/det/update             ---> rebuild the geometry
\endverbatim
   (MaxBin = 500 in both directions)	 

   An uniform magnetic field along the cylinder axis can be set.
   eg: 
\verbatim
/testem/det/setField 5 tesla 
\endverbatim
   
\section TestEm2_s2 PHYSICS LISTS
 
   Physics lists can be local (eg. in this example) or from G4 kernel
   physics_lists subdirectory.
   
   Local physics lists:	 
   - "local"	standard EM physics with current 'best' options setting.
              these options are explicited in PhysListEmStandard
    
   From geant4/source/physics_lists/builders:   
   - "emstandard_opt0" recommended standard EM physics for LHC
   - "emstandard_opt1" best CPU performance standard physics for LHC
   - "emstandard_opt2"     
   - "emstandard_opt3" best current advanced EM options. 
                       analog to "local" above 
   
   Physics lists and options can be (re)set with UI commands
   
   Please, notice that options set through G4EmProcessOPtions are global, eg
   for all particle types. In G4 builders, it is shown how to set options per
   particle type.

\section TestEm2_s3 AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR

   The primary kinematic consists of a single particle which hits the
   cylinder perpendicular to the input face. The type of the particle
   and its energy are set in the PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can
   changed via the G4 build-in commands of G4ParticleGun class (see
   the macros provided with this example).

   A RUN is a set of events.

\section TestEm2_s4 VISUALIZATION

   The Visualization Manager is set in the main () (see TestEm2.cc).
   The initialisation of the drawing is done via the commands
   /vis/.. in the macro vis.mac. In interactive session:
\verbatim
PreInit or Idle > /control/execute vis.mac
\endverbatim

   The detector has a default view which is a longitudinal view of the
   cylinder.

   The tracks are drawn at the end of event, and erased at the end of run.
   Optionaly one can choose to draw all particles, only the charged one,
   or none. This command is defined in EventActionMessenger class.

\section TestEm2_s5 PHYSICS DEMO

   The particle's type and the physic processes which will be available
   in this example are set in PhysicsList class.

   In addition a build-in interactive command (/process/inactivate proname)
   allows to activate/inactivate the processes one by one.

   The threshold for producing secondaries can be changed.
   eg: 
\verbatim
/testem/phys/setCuts 100 microm
/run/initialize
\endverbatim
	 
   The shower profiles are histogramed, if histograming is activated.
   They can be also printed with the command /testem/run/verbose 1     

\section TestEm2_s6 HOW TO START ?

   - Execute TestEm2 in 'batch' mode from macro files
\verbatim
% TestEm2   run01.mac
\endverbatim

   - Execute TestEm2 in 'interactive mode' with visualization
\verbatim
% TestEm2
....
Idle> type your commands
....
Idle> exit
\endverbatim

\section TestEm2_s7 HISTOGRAMS

   TestEm2 produces several histograms:

   Content of these histo:

   - 1 : energy deposit       per event
   - 2 : charged track length per event
   - 3 : neutral track length per event

   - 4 : longitudinal energy profile
   - 5 : rms of longitudinal energy profile      
   - 6 : cumulated longitudinal energy profile
   - 7 : rms of cumulated longitudinal energy profile

   - 8 : radial energy profile
   - 9 : rms of radial energy profile      
   - 10 : cumulated radial energy profile
   - 11 : rms of cumulated radial energy profile

 To define the output file name with histograms, use the UI command :
\verbatim
/testem/histo/setFileName name
\endverbatim
   
 The format of the histogram file can be : root (default),
 hbook, xml, csv, by selecting g4nnn.hh in RunAction.hh 
 
\subsection TestEm2_subs2 Using hbook format
 
 Need a special treatement : the Cern Library must be installed and the
 environment variable CERNLIB correctly set. Then, *before* compiling,
 activate G4_USE_HBOOK in GNUmakefile and g4hbook.hh in RunAction.hh
