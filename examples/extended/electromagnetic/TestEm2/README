     =========================================================
     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
     =========================================================

                            TestEm2
                            -------
     This example allows to do the shower development of an single primary
     particle, and to survey the physics processes which occur,
     with printing and visualization.

 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION

     The geometry consists of a cylinder of homegenous material.
     This cylinder is replicated longitudinaly (slice) and radialy (ring).

     The default geometry is constructed in DetectorConstruction class,
     but all of the above parameters can be modified interactively via
     the commands defined in the DetectorMessenger class.

     Material can be choosen: Air Water lAr Al Fe BGO PbWO4 Pb.
     eg: /testem/det/setMat PbWO4

     The size of the slices and rings are expressed in radiation length units
     and can be changed.
     eg: /testem/det/setLbin 20   1.    ---> 20 slices of 1. radl
         /testem/det/setRbin  5   0.25  --->  5 rings of 0.25 radl
         /testem/det/update             ---> rebuild the geometry

     An uniform magnetic field along the cylinder axis can be set.
     eg: /testem/det/setField 5 tesla 
     
 2- PHYSICS LISTS

    Modular PhysicsList are used. The following modules can be activated:
    1. "standard"    - (alternative) standard EM physics
    2. "g4v52"       - (alternative) standard EM physics version G4 5.2
    3. "high_energy" - add high energy processes

    To activate a specific module the UI command can be used:
    "/testem/phys/addPhysics  title"
    By default "standard" module is loaded.

 3- AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR

     The primary kinematic consists of a single particle which hits the
     cylinder perpendicular to the input face. The type of the particle
     and its energy are set in the PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can
     changed via the G4 build-in commands of ParticleGun class (see
     the macros provided with this example).

     A RUN is a set of events.

 4- VISUALIZATION

     The Visualization Manager is set in the main().
     The initialisation of the drawing is done via the commands
     /vis/.. in the macro vis.mac. In interactive session:
     PreInit or Idle > /control/execute vis.mac

     The detector has a default view which is a longitudinal view of the
     cylinder.

     The tracks are drawn at the end of event, and erased at the end of run.
     Optionaly one can choose to draw all particles, only the charged one,
     or none. This command is defined in EventActionMessenger class.

 5- PHYSICS DEMO

     The particle's type and the physic processes which will be available
     in this example are set in PhysicsList class.

     In addition a build-in interactive command (/process/inactivate proname)
     allows to activate/inactivate the processes one by one.

     The threshold for producing secondaries can be changed.
     eg: /testem/phys/setCuts 100 microm
         /run/initialize

 6- HOW TO START ?

     - compile and link to generate an executable
 		% cd TestEm2
 		% gmake

     - execute TestEm2 in 'batch' mode from macro files
 		% TestEm2   run01.mac

     - execute TestEm2 in 'interactive mode' with visualization
 		% TestEm2
 		....
 		Idle> type your commands
  		....
 		Idle> exit

 7- HISTOGRAMS

   TestEm2 produces several histograms:

     Content of these histo:

      1 : energy deposit       per event
      2 : charged track length per event
      3 : neutral track length per event

      4 : longitudinal energy profile
      5 : cumulated longitudinal energy profile
      6 : rms of cumulated longitudinal energy profile

      7 : gamma's flux
      8 : positron's flux
      9 : electron's flux

     10 : radial energy profile
     11 : cumulated radial energy profile
     12 : rms of cumulated radial energy profile

 Note that, by default, histograms are disabled. To activate them, uncomment
 the flag G4ANALYSIS_USE in GNUmakefile. To define the output file name with
 histograms and the type of these file the following UI commands can be used:

   "/testem/histo/setFileName name"
   "/testem/histo/setFileType type"

 The following types are available: "hbook", "root", "XML"
 By default the name is "testem2" and the type "hbook".
 
 Before compilation of the example it is optimal to clean up old files:
  	gmake histclean
  	gmake 

 8- USING HISTOGRAMS

  To use histograms, at least one of the AIDA implementations should be 
  available (see http://aida.freehep.org).
  
 8a - PI 

  A package including AIDA and extended interfaces also using Python is PI, 
  available from: http://cern.ch/pi

  Once installed PI or PI-Lite in a specified local area $MYPY, it is required 
  to add the installation path to $PATH, i.e. for example, for release 1.2.1 of 
  PI:
  setenv PATH ${PATH}:$MYPI/1.2.1/app/releases/PI/PI_1_2_1/rh73_gcc32/bin

  CERN users can use the PATH to the LCG area on AFS.
  Before running the example the command should be issued:
  eval `aida-config --runtime csh`

 8b -  OpenScientist
 
  OpenScientist is available at http://www.lal.in2p3.fr/OpenScientist
  
  In OpenScientist, the AIDA implementation is the Lab package. 
  You have to "setup" this package before compiling (then with G4ANALYSIS_USE) 
  and running your Geant4 application.
   
  On UNIX you setup, with a csh flavoured shell : 
	csh> setenv CMTPATH <OpenScientist install path> 
	csh> source <OpenScientist install path>/Lab/<version>/cmt/setup.csh 
  On UNIX with a sh flavoured shell : 
	sh> CMTPATH=<OpenScientist install path>;export CMTPATH 
	sh> . <OpenScientist install path>/Lab/<version>/cmt/setup.sh 
  On Windows : 
	DOS> set CMTPATH=<OpenScientist install path> 
	DOS> call <OpenScientist install path>/Lab/<version>/cmt/setup.bat 

  You have to use the XML or root file formats ; producing hbook files is not 
  supported by OpenScientist/Lab. But the three formats (hbook, AIDA-XML, root) 
  are readable by the interactive applications ; the Lab onx interactive 
  program or the OpenPAW program. 

  With OpenPAW, someone can view the histograms with : 
	OS> opaw 
	opaw> h/file 1 run0.aida   (or opaw> h/file 1 run1.root) 
	opaw> zone 2 2 
	opaw> h/plot 1 
	opaw> h/plot 2 
	opaw> h/plot 3
