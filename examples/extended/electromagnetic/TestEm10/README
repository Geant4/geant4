                            TestEm10 
                            --------

    Test for investigation of transition radiation. 
    Default setup for "TestEm10.in" and "TestEm10.large_N.in" is the simplified 
    setup for ALICE XTR test beam (~2004), defined in DetectorSimpleALICE class.


 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
    The geometry setup includes "radiator" and "absorber" volumes
    of a box shape.

    The "radiator" material is defined as a mixture of a gas and foil material
    and the "absorber" contains a gas material.

    Several geometry setups are defined in the classes 
    DetectorSetupX, 
    where SetupX = ALICE06, Bari05, Barr90, Construction, Harris73, Messenger, SimpleALICE, Watase86
 	
 	The default setup, SimpleALICE, can be changed via UI command:
    /XTRdetector/setup setup
       where setup = simpleALICE, alice06, bari05, harris73, watase86, barr90
 	
 2- PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
 	The primary kinematic consists of a single particle which hits the
 	absorber perpendicular to the input face. The type of the particle
 	and its energy are set in the PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can
 	be changed via the G4 build-in commands of G4ParticleGun class (see
 	the macros provided with this example).
 	
 3- DETECTOR RESPONSE

 	In this example the total energy deposited in the "absorber" volume 
    is accounted in SensitevDetector class, and a spectrum of XTR gamma
    particles, all secondary gamma particles and all secondary e- 
    particleas is accounted in StackingAction class.
 	
 4- PHYSICS
    
 	The particle's type and the physic processes which will be available
 	in this example are set in PhysicsList class.
    The trasition radiation process is defined in the
    TransitionRadiationPhysics builder.
 	 	
    The transition radiator models can be changed simply with:

    Idle> /emphyslist/setXTRModel modelName

    See macro files "*.mac" for different setups providede with the example.

 5 - HISTOGRAMS

    Testem10 produces several histo which are saved as testem10.root by default.
    Content of these histo:  
        1: Energy deposit in absorber
        2: XTR Gamma spectrum
        3: Secondary Gamma spectrum
        4: Secondary e- spectrum
        5: Energy deposit in absorber with the same histogram parameters
           as in the previous version of this example (Geant4 version <=10.2)
        
     The histograms are managed by G4AnalysisManager class and its Messenger. 
     The histos can be individually activated with the command :
     /analysis/h1/set id nbBins  valMin valMax unit 
     where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, deg or mrad, etc..)
     
     One can control the name of the histograms file with the command:
     /analysis/setFileName  name  (default testem1)
     
     It is possible to choose the format of the histogram file : root (default),
     hbook, xml, csv, by using namespace in HistoManager.hh 
       
     It is also possible to print selected histograms on an ascii file:
     /analysis/h1/setAscii id
     All selected histos will be written on a file name.ascii  (default testem1)

 6- HOW TO START ?
 
 	- execute TestEm10 in 'batch' mode from macro files e.g.
 		% TestEm10   run11.mac
		
 	- execute TestEm10 in 'interactive' mode with visualization e.g.
 		% TestEm10
		....
		Idle> type your commands
		....
