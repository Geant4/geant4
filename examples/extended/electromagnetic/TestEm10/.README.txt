/*! \page ExampleTestEm10 Example TestEm10

 Test for investigation of transition radiation. 
 Default setup for "TestEm10.in" and "TestEm10.large_N.in" is the simplified 
 setup for ALICE XTR test beam (~2004), defined in DetectorSimpleALICE class.

\section TestEm10_s0 GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
 The geometry setup includes "radiator" and "absorber" volumes
 of a box shape.

 The "radiator" material is defined as a mixture of a gas and foil material
 and the "absorber" contains a gas material.

 Several geometry setups are defined in the classes 
 DetectorSetupX, 
 where SetupX = ALICE06, Bari05, Barr90, Construction, Harris73, Messenger, SimpleALICE, Watase86

 The default setup, SimpleALICE, can be changed via UI command:
\verbatim
/XTRdetector/setup setup
     where setup = simpleALICE, alice06, bari05, harris73, watase86, barr90
\endverbatim

 	
\section TestEm10_s1 PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
 The primary kinematic consists of a single particle which hits the
 absorber perpendicular to the input face. The type of the particle
 and its energy are set in the PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can
 be changed via the G4 build-in commands of G4ParticleGun class (see
 the macros provided with this example).
 	
\section TestEm10_s2 DETECTOR RESPONSE

 In this example the total energy deposited in the "absorber" volume 
 is accounted in SensitevDetector class, and a spectrum of XTR gamma
 particles, all secondary gamma particles and all secondary e- 
 particleas is accounted in StackingAction class.
 				
\section TestEm10_s3 PHYSICS
 
 The particle's type and the physic processes which will be available
 in this example are set in PhysicsList class.
 The trasition radiation process is defined in the
 TransitionRadiationPhysics builder.
 
 The transition radiator models can be changed simply with:
\verbatim
Idle> /emphyslist/setXTRModel modelName
\endverbatim
 See macro files "*.mac" for different setups providede with the example.

\section TestEm10_s4 HISTOGRAMS

 Testem10 produces several histo which are saved as testem10.root by default.
 Content of these histo:  
  - 1. Energy deposit in absorber
  - 2. XTR Gamma spectrum
  - 3. Secondary Gamma spectrum
  - 4. Secondary e- spectrum
  - 5. Energy deposit in absorber with the same histogram parameters
       as in the previous version of this example (Geant4 version <=10.2)
     
  The histograms are managed by G4AnalysisManager class and its Messenger. 
  The histos can be individually activated with the command :
  /analysis/h1/set id nbBins  valMin valMax unit 
  where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, deg or mrad, etc..)
  
  One can control the name of the histograms file with the command:
\verbatim
/analysis/setFileName  name  (default testem1)
\endverbatim

  It is possible to choose the format of the histogram file : root (default),
  hbook, xml, csv, by using namespace in HistoManager.hh 
    
  It is also possible to print selected histograms on an ascii file:
\verbatim
/analysis/h1/setAscii id
\endverbatim
  All selected histos will be written on a file name.ascii  (default testem1)

\section TestEm10_s5 HOW TO START ?
 
 - Execute TestEm10 in 'batch' mode from macro files e.g.
\verbatim
% TestEm10   run11.mac
\endverbatim
		
 - Execute TestEm10 in 'interactive' mode with visualization e.g.
\verbatim
% TestEm10
....
Idle> type your commands
....
\endverbatim
