     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
     =========================================================

                            TestEm4
                            -------

	This example has been setup to test the low energy gamma processes. 
	
 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
 	It is a cylinder of 5 cm radius filled with C6F6.
 	
 2- PHYSICS LIST
 
 	The particle list contains only gamma, electron,positron.
 	The physics list contains the 'standard' electromagnetic processes.
 	 
 3- AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
 	The primary kinematic is a single 9 MeV gamma randomly shooted at the
 	middle of the cylinder. 
 	 				
 4- VISUALIZATION
 
 	The Visualization Manager is set in the main().
 	The initialisation of the drawing is done via the commands
 	/vis/.. in the macro vis.mac. This macro is
 	automatically read from the main in case of interactive running mode.
 	
 	The detector has a default view which is a transversal view of the 
 	cylinder.
 	
 	The tracks are drawn at the end of event, and erased at the end of run.
 	Optionaly one can choose to draw all particles, only the charged one,
 	or none. This command is defined in EventActionMessenger class.
 	
 5- PHYSICS SURVEY
 
   The energy deposited in C6F6 is histogramed.
 	
 6- HOW TO START ?
 
 	- compile and link to generate an executable
 		% cd examples/extended/electromagnetic/TestEm4
 		% gmake
 		
 	- execute TestEm4 in 'batch' mode from macro files
 		% TestEm4   run01.mac
 		
 	- execute TestEm4 in 'interactive mode' with visualization
 		% TestEm4
 		....
 		Idle> type your commands
 		....
 		Idle> exit
 		
 	- visualize the histogram (paw)
 		paw> h/file 1 testem4.hbook
 		paw> option stat
 		paw> option logy
 		paw> h/pl 1 	
  

 7- USING HISTOGRAMS

  By default the histograms are not activated. To activate histograms
  the environment variable G4ANALYSIS_USE should be defined. For instance
  uncomment the flag G4ANALYSIS_USE in GNUmakefile.

  Before compilation of the example it is optimal to clean up old files:
	gmake histclean
	gmake

  It is possible to choose the format of the histogram file (hbook, root, XML):
  comment/uncomment 1 line in the constructor of RunAction. 

  To use histograms, at least one of the AIDA implementations should be 
  available (see http://aida.freehep.org).
  
 7a - PI 

  A package including AIDA and extended interfaces also using Python is PI, 
  available from: http://cern.ch/pi

  Once installed PI or PI-Lite in a specified local area $MYPY, it is required 
  to add the installation path to $PATH, i.e. for example, for release 1.2.1 of 
  PI:
  setenv PATH ${PATH}:$MYPI/1.2.1/app/releases/PI/PI_1_2_1/rh73_gcc32/bin

  CERN users can use the PATH to the LCG area on AFS.
  Before running the example the command should be issued:
  eval `aida-config --runtime csh`

 7b -  OpenScientist
 
  OpenScientist is available at http://www.lal.in2p3.fr/OpenScientist
  
  In OpenScientist, the AIDA implementation is the Lab package. 
  You have to "setup" this package before compiling (then with G4ANALYSIS_USE) 
  and running your Geant4 application.
   
  On UNIX you setup, with a csh flavoured shell : 
	csh> setenv CMTPATH <OpenScientist install path> 
	csh> source <OpenScientist install path>/Lab/<version>/cmt/setup.csh 
  On UNIX with a sh flavoured shell : 
	sh> CMTPATH=<OpenScientist install path>;export CMTPATH 
	sh> . <OpenScientist install path>/Lab/<version>/cmt/setup.sh 
  On Windows : 
	DOS> set CMTPATH=<OpenScientist install path> 
	DOS> call <OpenScientist install path>/Lab/<version>/cmt/setup.bat 

  You have to use the XML or root file formats ; producing hbook files is not 
  supported by OpenScientist/Lab. But the three formats (hbook, AIDA-XML, root) 
  are readable by the interactive applications ; the Lab onx interactive 
  program or the OpenPAW program. 

  With OpenPAW, someone can view the histograms with : 
	OS> opaw 
	opaw> h/file 1 run0.aida   (or opaw> h/file 1 run1.root) 
	opaw> zone 2 2 
	opaw> h/plot 1 
	opaw> h/plot 2 
	opaw> h/plot 3
