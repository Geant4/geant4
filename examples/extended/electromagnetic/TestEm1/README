     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
     =========================================================

                            TestEm1
                            -------

	This example has been setup to test individualy the electromagnetic
	processes. 
	
 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
 	It is a simple box which represente an 'semi infinite' homogeneous 
	medium.
 	
 	Two parameters define the geometry :
 	- the material of the box,
	- the full size of the box.
	 	
 	In addition a transverse uniform magnetic field can be applied.
 	
 	The default geometry is constructed in DetectorConstruction class,
 	but all of the above parameters can be changed interactively via
 	the commands defined in the DetectorMessenger class.
 	
 2- PHYSICS LIST
 
 	The particle list is the one of novice/exampleN03.
 	The physics list contains the 'standard' electromagnetic processes,
 	and decay.
 		
 	Few commands have been added to PhysicsList, in order to set the
 	production threshold for secondaries either in range for gamma,
 	e-/e+, proton or directly in energy for all charged.
 	 
 3- AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
 	The primary kinematic consists of a single particle starting at the
 	left face of the box. The type of the particle and its energy are set 
 	in the PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can be changed via the G4 
 	build-in commands of ParticleGun class (see the macros provided with 
 	this example).
	
 	In addition one can choose randomly the impact point of the incident
 	particle. The corresponding interactive command is built in
 	PrimaryGeneratorMessenger class.
	 	
 	A RUN is a set of events.
 	
 				
 4- VISUALIZATION
 
 	The Visualization Manager is set in the main().
 	The initialisation of the drawing is done via the commands
 	/vis/... in the macro vis.mac. To get visualisation:
 	> /control/execute vis.mac
 	
 	The detector has a default view which is a longitudinal view of the 
 	box.
 	
 	The tracks are drawn at the end of event, and erased at the end of run.
 	Optionaly one can choose to draw all particles, only the charged one,
 	or none. This command is defined in EventActionMessenger class.
 	
 5- PHYSICS SURVEY
 
 	The particle's type and the physic processes which will be available
 	in this example are set in PhysicsList class.
 	
 	A set of macros defining various run conditions are provided.
 	The processes are actived/inactived together with differents
 	cuts, in order to survey the processes one by one.

	The number of produced secondaries are counted, the number of steps,
	and the number of process calls responsible of the step.
 	
 6- HOW TO START ?
 
 	- compile and link to generate an executable
 		% cd geant4/examples/extended/electromagnetic/TestEm1
 		% gmake
 		
 	- execute TestEm1 in 'batch' mode from macro files
 		% TestEm1   run10.mac
 		
 	- execute TestEm1 in 'interactive mode' with visualization
 		% TestEm1
 		....
 		Idle> type your commands
 		....
 		Idle> exit
 	
 7- HISTOGRAMS
 
   Testem1 produces several histo which are saved as testem1.aida by default.
     
     Content of these histo:
  
      1 : track length of a charged particle
      2 : number of steps per track (charged particle)
      3 : step length (charged particle)

 Note that, by default, histograms are disabled. To activate them, uncomment
 the flag G4ANALYSIS_USE in GNUmakefile.
 

 8- Using histograms
 ------------------- 

By default the histograms are not activated. To activate histograms
the environment variable G4ANALYSIS_USE should be defined. For instance
uncomment the flag G4ANALYSIS_USE in GNUmakefile.

To use histograms any of implementations of AIDA interfaces should
be available (see http://aida.freehep.org).

A package including AIDA and extended interfaces also using Python
is PI, available from: http://cern.ch/pi .

Once installed PI or PI-Lite in a specified local area $MYPY, it is
required to add the installation path to $PATH, i.e. for example,
for release 1.2.1 of PI:

setenv PATH ${PATH}:$MYPI/1.2.1/app/releases/PI/PI_1_2_1/rh73_gcc32/bin

CERN users can use the PATH to the LCG area on AFS.

Before compilation of the example it is optimal to clean up old 
files:

gmake histclean
gmake

Before running the example the command should be issued:

eval `aida-config --runtime csh`
