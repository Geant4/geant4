 Example for investigation of ionisation in thin absorbers and gaseous
 detectors
	
\section TestEm8_s1 GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
 The target is a cylinder made of a given material placed inside
 cylindrical container, which is placed inside the world volume.
 
 Following parameters define the geometry:
 - the material of the target,
 - the thickness of the target,
 - the radius of the target, 
 - the material of the container,
 - the thickness of the container,
 - the material of the world.
 
 The list of materials used in gaseous detectors are built inside
 the DetectorConstruction class, also NIST materials are available. 
 The default geometry is provided but all parameters can be changed via
 UI commands defined in the DetectorMessenger class, for example,

\verbatim
/testem/setGasMat      XeCH4C3H8
/testem/setWindowMat   G4_MYLAR
/testem/setWorldMat    G4_AIR
/testem/setGasThick    10 cm
/testem/setGasRad      20 cm
/testem/setWindowThick 50 um
\endverbatim

\section TestEm8_s2 AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
  The primary kinematic consists of a single particle which hits the
  absorber perpendicular to the input face. The type of the particle
  and its energy can be set via the G4 build-in commands of G4ParticleGun .
  A RUN is a set of events.
 	
\section TestEm8_s3 DETECTOR RESPONSE

  The TargetSD class sending information about each step inside the target
  to the HistoManager class scoring of energy deposition in the detector.
  Additionally at each step of a particle inside the target the number of 
  ionisation clusters is sampled using G4ElectronIonPair helper class. The
  parameter of transformation of energy into ionisation clusters can be
  set via UI command:

\verbatim
/testem/setPairEnergy 19 eV
\endverbatim

\section TestEm8_s4 PHYSICS 
 
  The particle's type and the physics processes which will be available
  in this example are set in PhysicsList class, which uses Geant4
  EM physics constructors provided in the physics_list library.

  The PhysicsListMessenger classes introduce interactive commands. In particular,
  PAI ionisation model can be added using G4EmConfigurator helper class,
  which is invoked by the UI command

\verbatim
/testem/phys/addPhysics pai
\endverbatim

\section TestEm8_s5- HOW TO START ?
 
  - Execute TestEm8 in 'batch' mode from macro files e.g.
\verbatim
% $(G4INSTALL)/bin/$(G4SYSTEM)/TestEm8  TestEm8.in N
\endverbatim
    here N means number of threads in multi-threaded mode, by
    default 2 threads are used
		
  - Execute TestEm8 in 'interactive' mode with visualization e.g.
\verbatim
% $(G4INSTALL)/bin/$(G4SYSTEM)/TestEm8
....
Idle> type your commands
....
\endverbatim
