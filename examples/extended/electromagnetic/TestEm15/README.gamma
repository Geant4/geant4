All discrete processes are inactivated (see macro),
so Gamma Conversion is 'forced'.

Histograms :

  10    # Open Angle (rad)* E gamma (MeV)
The most probable value of the e+ e- pair opening angle multiplied by the
photon energy is 1.6 rad*MeV and 338 rad*MeV in case mu+ mu- pair.
See: Olsen, Phys. Rev. 131 (1963) 406.
See also: Fig. 7 of arXiv:1802.08253 and Fig. 6 arXiv:1910.12501.

  11    # Log10 ( recoil momentum)
The distribution of the  recoil momentum is described by
Jost, Phys. Rev. 80 (1950) 189 (no form factor).
See also Fig. 2 of Astroparticle Physics 88 (2017) 60.

  12    # Phi recoil
  13    # Phi positron
  For linearly polarized incident photons, the distributions should show
  a sinusoidal shape with period 180Â°, for non polarized incident photons,
  the distribution of azimuthal angles should be flat.


 14    # Asymmetry 2 * cos(phi_+ + phi_-)
For a photon propagating along x, polarized along y,
the average value of ( 2.0 * cos(phi_+ + phi_-) ),
provides a measurement of the polarization asymmetry, A.
Eq. (12) of Nucl. Instrum. Meth. A 729 (2013) 765
The azimuthal angle of the event defined as the bisector angle
of the azimuthal angles of the positron and of the electron,
(phi_+ + phi_-)/2,
provides the optimal measurement of the asymmetry
Astroparticle Physics 88 (2017) 30.

For high-energy photons (E >> 20 MeV), the asymptotic expression for A
can be used for comparison.

See also eq. (13) of arXiv:1802.08253
Example : A ~ 0.17 at 100 GeV.

  15    # E plus / E gamma
x_+ = E plus / E gamma has a more-or-less flat spectrum that extends
almost from 0. to 1.
See Fig. 16 page 261 of "The Quantum Theory of Radiation", W. Heitler,
3rd edition, 1954.

 16  # Phi of Gamma Polarization
The phi of polarization vector after transformation into reference system
 defined by gamma direction (z) , gamma polarization (x).

UI commands:

There are two commands to control G4BetheHeitler5DModel:

/process/gconv/conversionType itype
/process/gconv/onIsolated bool

The command:
/process/gconv/conversionType

Allow to force conversion on nuclear or electron
The parameter values
0 - (default) both triplet and nuclear conversion in proportion triplet/nuclear 1/Z
1 - force nuclear conversion
2 - force triplet

The command:
/process/gconv/onIsolated

Allow simulate conversion on isolated particles without screening
The perimeter values:
false - (default) atomic electron screening
true - conversion on isolated particles

One more command for G4GammaConversionToMuons.

To enable gamma to mu+ mu- conversion use command:

/process/em/max5DMuPairEnergy emax5D units
The conversion disabled by default, emax5D set to 0.0

The model tested for the energies about the threshold up to PeV range.
