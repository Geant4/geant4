        How to compute and plot the final state of Multiple Scattering 
        or Gamma Conversion considered as an isolated processes.
        The method is exposed below : see item Physics. 
        
 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
        It is a single box representing a 'semi infinite' homogeneous medium.
        Two parameters define the geometry :
        - the material of the box,
        - the (full) size of the box.
        
        The default geometry (100 m of water) is constructed in 
        DetectorConstruction, but the above parameters can be changed 
        interactively via the commands defined in DetectorMessenger.
        
 2- PHYSICS LIST
 
        The physics list contains the standard electromagnetic processes.
        In order not to introduce 'artificial' constraints on the step size, 
        there is no limitation from the maximum energy lost per step.  
         
 3- AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
        The primary kinematic consists of a single particle starting at the edge
        of the box. The type of the particle and its energy are set in 
        PrimaryGeneratorAction (1 MeV electron), and can be changed via the G4 
        build-in commands of ParticleGun class (see the macros provided with 
        this example).
        
 4- PHYSICS
 
        All discrete processes are inactivated (see provided macros),
        so that Multiple Scattering or Gamma Conversion is 'forced' to
        determine the first step of the primary particle.
        The step size and the final state are computed  and plotted.
        Then the event is immediately killed.
        
        The result is compared with the 'input' data, i.e. with the cross
        sections stored in the PhysicsTables and used by Geant4.
        
        The stepMax command provides an additional control of the step size of
        the multiple scattering.
        

 5- HISTOGRAMS
         
        The test contains 16 built-in 1D histograms, which are managed by 
        G4AnalysisManager and its Messenger. The histos can be individually 
        activated with the command :
        /analysis/h1/set id nbBins  valMin valMax unit 
        where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, etc..)
        (see the macros xxxx.mac).
                
        1       Multiple Scattering. True step length
        2       Multiple Scattering. Geom step length
        3       Multiple Scattering. Ratio geomSl/trueSl
        4       Multiple Scattering. Lateral displacement: radius
        5       Multiple Scattering. Lateral displac: psi_space
        6       Multiple Scattering. Angular distrib: theta_plane
        7       Multiple Scattering. Phi-position angle
        8       Multiple Scattering. Phi-direction angle
        9       Multiple Scattering. Correlation: cos(phiPos-phiDir)

        10      Gamma Conversion. Open Angle * Egamma
        11      Gamma Conversion. Log10(P recoil)
        12      Gamma Conversion. Phi P recoil angle
        13      Gamma Conversion. Phi P plus angle
        14      Gamma Conversion. 2 * cos(phiplus + phiminus) Asymmetry
        15      Gamma Conversion. E plus / E gamma
        16      Gamma Conversion. Phi of Gamma Polarization

      
   The histograms are managed by the HistoManager class and its Messenger. 
   The histos can be individually activated with the command :
   /analysis/h1/set id nbBins  valMin valMax unit 
   where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, deg or mrad, etc..)
   
   One can control the name of the histograms file with the command:
   /analysis/setFileName  name  (default testem15)
   
   It is possible to choose the format of the histogram file : root (default),
   hbook, xml, csv, by using namespace in HistoManager.hh       
        
   It is also possible to print selected histograms on an ascii file:
   /analysis/h1/setAscii id
   All selected histos will be written on a file name.ascii (default testem15)
                                        
 6- VISUALIZATION
 
        The Visualization Manager is set in the main().
        The initialization of the drawing is done via the commands
        /vis/... in the macro vis.mac. To get visualization:
        > /control/execute vis.mac
        
        The detector has a default view which is a longitudinal view of the 
        box.
        
        The tracks are drawn at the end of event, and erased at the end of run.
        
 7- HOW TO START ?
 
        execute TestEm15 in 'batch' mode from macro files :
                % TestEm15   compt.mac
                
        execute TestEm15 in 'interactive mode' with visualization :
                % TestEm15
                Idle> control/execute vis.mac
                ....
                Idle> type your commands
                ....
                Idle> exit
