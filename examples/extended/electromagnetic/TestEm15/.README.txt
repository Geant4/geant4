  How to compute and plot the final state of Multiple Scattering 
  considered as an isolated process.
  The method is exposed below : see \ref TestEm15_s4. 
  
\section TestEm15_s1 GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
  It is a single box representing a 'semi infinite' homogeneous medium.
  Two parameters define the geometry :
  - the material of the box,
  - the (full) size of the box.
   
  The default geometry (100 m of water) is constructed in 
  DetectorConstruction, but the above parameters can be changed 
  interactively via the commands defined in DetectorMessenger.
   
\section TestEm15_s2 PHYSICS LIST
 
  The physics list contains the standard electromagnetic processes.
  In order not to introduce 'articicial' constraints on the step size, 
  there is no limitation from the maximum energy lost per step.  
    
\section TestEm15_s3 AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
  The primary kinematic consists of a single particle starting at the edge
  of the box. The type of the particle and its energy are set in 
  PrimaryGeneratorAction (1 MeV electron), and can be changed via the G4 
  build-in commands of G4ParticleGun class (see the macros provided with 
  this example).
   
\section TestEm15_s4 PHYSICS
 
  All discrete processes are inactivated (see provided macros),
  so that Multiple Scattering is 'forced' to determine the first step of 
  the primary particle. The step size and the final state are computed 
  and plotted. Then the event is immediately killed.
  
  The result is compared with the 'input' data, i.e. with the cross
  sections stored in the PhysicsTables and used by Geant4.
  
  The stepMax command provides an additionnal control of the step size of
  the multiple scattering.
   

\section TestEm15_s5 HISTOGRAMS
         
  The test contains 9 built-in 1D histograms, which are managed by the
  HistoManager class and its Messenger. The histos can be individually 
  activated with the command :
\verbatim  
/analysis/h1/set id nbBins  valMin valMax unit 
\endverbatim  
  where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, etc..)
  (see the macros xxxx.mac).
     
   - 1 :  Multiple Scattering. True step length
   - 2 :  Multiple Scattering. Geom step length
   - 3 :  Multiple Scattering. Ratio geomSl/trueSl
   - 4 :  Multiple Scattering. Lateral displacement: radius
   - 5 :  Multiple Scattering. Lateral displac: psi_space
   - 6 :  Multiple Scattering. Angular distrib: theta_plane
   - 7 :  Multiple Scattering. Phi-position angle
   - 8 :  Multiple Scattering. Phi-direction angle
   - 9 :  Multiple Scattering. Correlation: cos(phiPos-phiDir)
      
   The histograms are managed by the HistoManager class and its Messenger. 
   The histos can be individually activated with the command :
\verbatim
/analysis/h1/set id nbBins  valMin valMax unit 
\endverbatim
   where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, deg or mrad, etc..)
   
   One can control the name of the histograms file with the command:
\verbatim
/analysis/setFileName  name  (default testem15)
\endverbatim
   
   It is possible to choose the format of the histogram file : root (default),
   hbook, xml, csv, by using namespace in HistoManager.hh   
  
   It is also possible to print selected histograms on an ascii file:
\verbatim
/analysis/h1/setAscii id
\endverbatim
   All selected histos will be written on a file name.ascii (default testem15)
            
\section TestEm15_s6 VISUALIZATION
 
   The Visualization Manager is set in the main () (see TestEm15.cc).
   The initialisation of the drawing is done via the commands
   /vis/... in the macro vis.mac. To get visualisation:
\verbatim
> /control/execute vis.mac
\endverbatim
   
   The detector has a default view which is a longitudinal view of the 
   box.
   
   The tracks are drawn at the end of event, and erased at the end of run.
  
\section TestEm15_s7- HOW TO START ?
 
  - Execute TestEm15 in 'batch' mode from macro files :
\verbatim
% TestEm15   compt.mac
\endverbatim
     
  - Execute TestEm15 in 'interactive mode' with visualization :
\verbatim
% TestEm15
Idle> control/execute vis.mac
....
Idle> type your commands
....
Idle> exit
\endverbatim
