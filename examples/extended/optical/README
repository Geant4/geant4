			 -----------------

This directory includes examples demonstrating the use of optical processes
in the simulation.

OpNovice
--------
Simulation of optical photons generation and transport.
Defines optical surfaces and exercises optical physics processes
(Cerenkov, Scintillation, Absorption, Rayleigh, ...). Uses stacking
mechanism to count the secondary particles generated.

OpNovice2
--------
Investigate optical properties and parameters. Details of optical
photon boundary interactions on a surface are recorded. Details 
of optical photon generation and transport are recorded.

LXe
----
Multi-purpose detector setup implementing:
(1) scintillation inside a bulk scintillator with PMTs
(2) large wall of small PMTs opposite a Cerenkov slab to show the cone
(3) plastic scintillator with wave-length-shifting fiber readout.

WLS
----
This application simulates the propagation of photons inside a Wave Length
Shifting (WLS) fiber.
