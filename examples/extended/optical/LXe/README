Introduction
------------

This example demonstrates usage of optical physics. 

-----------------------------
Geometry and primary particle
-----------------------------

The main volume is a box of LXe. PMTs are placed around the outside. There
may be a reflective sphere placed inside the box, and a wavelength shifting
slab and fibers.

The geometry implementation is different from many of the other examples. 
See the discussion below.

G4ParticleGun creates the primary particle. The type of particle is selectable
by the user.

Physics

The physics list is FTFP_BERT, with G4EmStandard_option4 electromagnetic
physics and G4OpticalPhysics.

-----------
Macro files
-----------

cerenkov.mac disables scintillation, so the optical photons that are produced
are Cerenkov photons.

wls.mac implements a scintillating slab and wavelength shifting fibers.

 1  "hits per event"
 2  "hits per event above threshold"
 3  "scintillation photons per event"
 4  "Cerenkov photons per event"
 5  "absorbed photons per event"
 6  "photons absorbed at boundary per event"
 7  "energy deposition in scintillator per event"


-------------
How to start?
-------------

  - execute LXe in 'batch' mode from macro files, e.g.
    $ ./LXe cerenkov.mac

  - execute LXe in 'interactive' mode with visualization, e.g.
    $ ./LXe
    Then type commands, for instance
    Session: /run/beamOn 1


-----------------------------------------------
Detailed Explanation of Geometry Implementation
-----------------------------------------------

The way the geometry is constructed is an experiment for a new, more object
oriented, way to construct geometry. It separates the concept of how a volume
is built from where it is placed. Each major volume in the geometry is defined
as a class derived from G4PVPlacement. In this example, just the main LXe
volume, the WLS scintillator slab, and the WLS fibers were chosen. To place
one of these volumes, simply create an instance of it with the appropriate
rotation, translation, and mother volumes.

    LXeMainVolume(G4RotationMatrix *pRot,
                  const G4ThreeVector &tlate,
                  G4LogicalVolume *pMotherLogical,
                  G4bool pMany,
                  G4int pCopyNo,
                  LXeDetectorConstruction* c);

Also necessary are the pMany and pCopyNo variables with the same usage as in 
G4PVPlacement. Additionally, the detector construction must be passed to the
main volume as a way to communicate the many parameters to the volume and its
sub-volumes. The communication is done from the CopyValues() function which
retrieves the information from the detector constructor.

Notably, the name and logical volume parameters are no longer part of the
constructor. This is because they are both to be decided by the volume itself.
The volume must specify its own name and a temporary logical volume. The
constructor will then procede to define its logical volume in the normal way.
Once complete, the logical volume can be assigned to the physical volume using
the SetLogicalVolume() function.

To handle instances of the same type of volume, a new logical volume should not
be defined for each one. Instead, the logical volume is kept as a static member
and defined only once. 

    if (!housing_log || updated) {
      //...
      //Define logical volume
      //...
    }
    SetLogicalVolume(housing_log);

The updated variable is to signal that the volume needs to be updated and a new
logical volume made.

---------------------------------
Modifying the geometry at runtime
---------------------------------

This example allows the user to modify the geometry definition at runtime. This
is accomplished through LXeDetectorMessenger, a derived class of G4UImessenger.
The commands it adds change variables stored in LXeDetectorConstructor that
are used when constructing the geometry. 

    void LXeDetectorConstruction::UpdateGeometry(){
      // clean-up previous geometry
      G4SolidStore::GetInstance()->Clean();
      G4LogicalVolumeStore::GetInstance()->Clean();
      G4PhysicalVolumeStore::GetInstance()->Clean();

      //define new one
      G4RunManager::GetRunManager()->DefineWorldVolume(ConstructDetector());
      G4RunManager::GetRunManager()->GeometryHasBeenModified();
    }

----------------------
PMT sensitive detector
----------------------

The PMT sensitive detector cannot be triggered like a normal sensitive detector
because the sensitive volume does not allow photons to pass through it. Rather,
it detects them in the OpBoundary process based on an efficiency set on the
skin of the volume.


    G4OpticalSurface* photocath_opsurf=
       new G4OpticalSurface("photocath_opsurf",glisur,polished,
                             dielectric_metal);
    G4double photocath_EFF[num]={1.,1.};
    G4double photocath_REFL[num]={0.,0.};
    G4MaterialPropertiesTable* photocath_mt = new G4MaterialPropertiesTable();
    photocath_mt->AddProperty("EFFICIENCY",Ephoton,photocath_EFF,num);
    photocath_mt->AddProperty("REFLECTIVITY",Ephoton,photocath_REFL,num);
    photocath_opsurf->SetMaterialPropertiesTable(photocath_mt);
    new G4LogicalSkinSurface("photocath_surf",photocath_log,photocath_opsurf);


A normal sensitive detector would have its ProcessHits 
function called for each step by a particle inside the volume. So, to record
these hits with a sensitive detector we watched the status of the OpBoundary
process from the stepping manager whenever a photon hit the sensitive volume
of the pmt. If the status was 'Detection', we retrieve the sensitive detector
from G4SDManager and call its ProcessHits function.


    boundaryStatus=boundary->GetStatus();
    //Check to see if the particle was actually at a boundary
    //Otherwise the boundary status may not be valid
    //Prior to Geant4.6.0-p1 this would not have been enough to check
    if(thePostPoint->GetStepStatus()==fGeomBoundary){
      switch(boundaryStatus){
      //...    
        case Detection: //Note, this assumes that the volume causing detection
                        //is the photocathode because it is the only one with
                  //non-zero efficiency
    {
      //Trigger sensitive detector manually since photon is
      //absorbed but status was Detection
      G4SDManager* SDman = G4SDManager::GetSDMpointer();
      G4String sdName="/LXeDet/pmtSD";
      LXePMTSD* pmtSD = (LXePMTSD*)SDman
        ->FindSensitiveDetector(sdName);
      if(pmtSD)
        pmtSD->ProcessHits_constStep(theStep,NULL);
      break;
    }
        //...
      }


--------------------------------------------------------
Selectively drawing trajectories or highlighting volumes
--------------------------------------------------------

In a simulation such as this one, where an average of 6000 trajectories are
generated in a small space, there is little use in drawing all of them. There
are two ways to select which ones to draw. The first of which is to decide
while looping through the trajectory container which ones to draw and only call
DrawTrajectory on the important ones. However, trajectories only contain a
small portion of the information from the track it represents. This may not
be enough to decide if a trajectory is worth drawing.

The alternative is to define your own trajectory class to store additional
information to help decide if it should be drawn. To use your custom trajectory
you must create it in the PreUserTrackingAction:

fpTrackingManager->SetTrajectory(new LXeTrajectory(aTrack));

Then at any point you can get access to the trajectory you can update the extra
information within it. When it comes to drawing, you can then use this to
decide if you want to call DrawTrajectory. Or you can call DrawTrajectory for
all trajectories and have the logic decide how and if a trajectory should
be drawn inside the DrawTrajectory function itself.

Selectively highlighting volumes is useful to show which volumes were hit. To
do this, you simply need a pointer to the physical volume. With that, you can
modify its vis attributes and instruct the vis manager to redraw the volume
with the new vis attributes.

    G4VisAttributes attribs(G4Colour(1.,0.,0.));
    attribs.SetForceSolid(true);
    G4RotationMatrix rot;
    if(physVol->GetRotation())//If a rotation is defined use it
      rot=*(physVol->GetRotation());
    G4Transform3D trans(rot,physVol->GetTranslation());//Create transform
    pVVisManager->Draw(*physVol,attribs,trans);//Draw it

In this case, it is done in Draw function of a PMT hit but it can be placed
anywhere. The logic to decide if it should be drawn or not may be similar to
the logic used in choosing which trajectories to draw.

See /LXe/detector/volumes/sphere in "UI commands" below for info on what 
trajectories are drawn in this simulation.

--------------------------
Saving random engine seeds
--------------------------

At times it may be necessary to review a particular event of interest. To do
this without redoing an entire run, which may take a long time, you must store
the random engine seed from the beginning of the event. The run manager
has some functions that help in this task.

G4RunManager::SetRandomNumberStore(G4bool)

When set to true, this causes the run manager to write the seed for the
beginning of the current run to CurrentRun.rndm and the current event to 
CurrentEvent.rndm. However, at the beginning of each event this file will be 
overwritten with the new event. To keep a copy for a particular event there is
a function to copy this file to run###evt###.rndm.

G4RunManager::rndmSaveThisEvent()

This can be done for every event so you can review any event you like but this
may be awkward for runs with very large numbers of events. Instead, implement
some form of logic in EndOfEventAction to decide if the event is worth saving.
If it is, then call rndmSaveThisEvent(). By default, these files are stored in
the current working directory. There is a function to change this as well.
Typically you would call that at the same time SetRandomNumberStore. The
directory to save in must exist first. GEANT4 will not create it for you.

G4RunManager::SetRandomNumberStoreDir(G4String)

UI commands
-----------

Directories:
/LXe/ - All custom commands belong below this directory
/LXe/detector/ - Geometry related commands
/LXe/detector/volumes/ - Commands to enable/disable volumes in the geometry

Commands:
/LXe/saveThreshold <int, default = 4500>
-Specifies a threshold for saving the random seed for an event. If the number
of photons generated in an event is below this number then the random seed is
saved to ./random/run###evt###.rndm. See "Saving random engine seeds".

/LXe/eventVerbose <int, default = 1>
-Enables end of event verbose data to be printed. This includes information
counted and calculated by the user action classes.

/LXe/pmtThreshold <int, default = 1>
-Sets the PMT threshold in # of photons being detected by the PMT. PMTs below
with fewer hits than the threshold will not count as being hit and will also
not be highlighted at the end of the event.

/LXe/oneStepPrimaries <bool>
-This causes primary particles to be killed after going only one step inside
the scintillator volume. This is useful to view the photons generated during 
the initial conversion of the primary particle.

/LXe/forceDrawPhotons <bool>
-Forces all optical photon trajectories to be drawn at the end of the event 
regardless of the scheme mentioned in /LXe/detector/volumes/sphere below.

/LXe/forceDrawNoPhotons <bool>
-Forces all optical photon trajectories to NOT be drawn at the end of the 
event regardless of the scheme mentioned in /LXe/detector/volumes/sphere below.
-If /LXe/forceDrawPhotons is set to true, this has no effect.

/LXe/detector/dimensions <double x y z> <unit, default = cm>
-Sets the dimensions of the main scintillator volume.

/LXe/detector/housingThickness <double>
-Sets the thickness of the housing surrounding the main detector volume.

/LXe/detector/pmtRadius <double> <unit, default = cm>
-Sets the radius of the PMTs

/LXe/detector/nx
/LXe/detector/ny
/LXe/detector/nz
-Sets the number of PMTs placed in a row along each axis.

/LXe/detector/reflectivity <double>
-Sets the reflectivity of the inside of the aluminum housing. The geometry
uses a default value of 1.00 for a fully reflective surface.

/LXe/detector/nfibers <int>
-Sets the number of WLS fibers placed in the WLS scintillator slab. The
geometry uses a default value of 15 fibers.

/LXe/detector/scintYieldFactor <double>
-Sets the yield factor for the scintillation process. This is cumulative with
the yield factor set on individual materials. Set to 0 to produce no 
scintillation photons.

/LXe/detector/defaults
-Resets all detector values customizable with commands above to their defaults.

/LXe/detector/volumes/sphere <bool>
-Enables/disables the sphere placed inside the main scintillator volume. When
the sphere is enabled, only photons that hit the sphere and hit a PMT are
drawn. If it is disabled, then all photons that hit PMTs are drawn.

/LXe/detector/volumes/wls <bool>
-Enables/disables the WLS scintillator slab containing WLS fibers. By default
this is not part of the geometry. Enabling it will place it behind the LXe
scintillator volume.

/LXe/detector/volumes/lxe <bool>
-Enables/disables the main LXe scintillator volume. By default this is part of
the geometry.
