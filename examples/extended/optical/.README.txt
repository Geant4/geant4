This directory includes examples demonstrating the use of optical processes
in the simulation.

\link ExampleOpNovice OpNovice \endlink

Simulation of optical photons generation and transport.
Defines optical surfaces and exercises optical physics processes
(Cerenkov, Scintillation, Absorption, Rayleigh, ...). Uses stacking
mechanism to count the secondary particles generated.

\link ExampleOpNovice2 OpNovice2 \endlink

Investigate optical properties and parameters. Details of optical
photon boundary interactions on a surface are recorded. Details 
of optical photon generation and transport are recorded.

\link ExampleLXe LXe \endlink

Multi-purpose detector setup implementing:
-# scintillation inside a bulk scintillator with PMTs
-# large wall of small PMTs opposite a Cerenkov slab to show the cone
-# plastic scintillator with wave-length-shifting fiber readout.

\link Examplewls wls \endlink

This application simulates the propagation of photons inside a Wave Length
Shifting (WLS) fiber.
