A01 Example
-----------
By default (without sourcing setup-analysis) the compilation
will link in a DummyAnalysisFactory which will not produce
anything for analysis.

The default graphics drivers are always linked in and can be used
to generate event output.

You can link this example with a specific AIDA compliant
analysis implementation. See other READMEs.
