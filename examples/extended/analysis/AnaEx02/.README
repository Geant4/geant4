/*! \page ExampleAnaEx02 Example AnaEx02

 This example shows the usage of histogram and tuple manipulations using 
 ROOT system. All analysis manipulations (histo booking, filling, saving 
 histos in a file, etc...) are located in one class : HistoManager. 
 Please install ROOT before building this example: 
 http://root.cern.ch

 
 The example is an adaptation of examples/novice/N03. It describes a simple 
 sampling calorimeter setup.
	
\section AnaEx02_s1 Detector description
 
 The calorimeter is a box made of a given number of layers. A layer
 consists of an absorber plate and of a detection gap. The layer is
 replicated.
 	
 Six parameters define the calorimeter :
 	- the material of the absorber,
	- the thickness of an absorber plate,
 	- the material of the detection gap,
 	- the thickness of a  gap,
 	- the number of layers,
 	- the transverse size of the calorimeter (the input face is a square). 
 	
 The default geometry is constructed in DetectorConstruction class,
 but all of the above parameters can be modified interactively via
 the commands defined in the DetectorMessenger class.

\section AnaEx02_s2 An event : PrimaryGeneratorAction
 
 The primary kinematic consists of a single particle which hits the
 calorimeter perpendicular to the input face. The type of the particle
 and its energy are set in the PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can
 be changed via the G4 build-in commands of ParticleGun class.
 	

\section AnaEx02_s3 Histograms

 To produce histograms, ROOT system must be installed
    
 AnaEx02 can produce 4 histograms :
  
  - histo 1 : total energy deposit in absorber per event
  - histo 2 : total energy deposit in gap per event	  
  - histo 3 : total track length of charged particles in absorber per event 	
  - histo 4 : total track length of charged particles in gap per event 
 
 And 1 Ntuple :
 -  one row per event : EnergyAbs EnergyGap TrackLAbs TrackLGap
  
 These histos are booked in HistoManager and filled from EventAction.
 
 One can control the name of the histograms file :
 - default name     : AnaEx02
 Format : root
 
 See HistoManager constructor
