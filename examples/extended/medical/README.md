 Specific examples for medical physics applications are demonstarted 
 in this directory. 

\ref Examples_DICOM

These example serve first to convert a DICOM file to a simple ASCII 
file, where the Hounsfield numbers are converted to materials and 
densities so that it can be used by GEANT4. They serve also to create 
a GEANT4 geometry based on the DICOM file information using the 
G4PhantomParameterisation. 

\ref Examples_dna

Set of examples using the Geant4-DNA physics processes and models.

\ref ExampleelectronScattering
\ref ExampleelectronScattering2

These example demonstrate electron scattering benchmarks. 
ElectronScattering2 simulates the experiment with a minimum of user code, whereas the other
version of this example shows how to do more of the work directly as the user.

\ref ExamplefanoCavity

This example computes the dose deposited in an ionization chamber by a
monoenergetic photon beam.

\ref ExamplefanoCavity2

This example computes the dose deposited in an ionization chamber by an
extended (one dimensional) monoenergetic electron source.
This variante of the Fano cavity test make use of an reciprocity theorem.

\ref ExampleGammaTherapy

This example demonstrates a gamma therapy application.

\ref Exampleradiobiology

An application realized for dosimetric and radiobiological applications of proton
and ion beams.
