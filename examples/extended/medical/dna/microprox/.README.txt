(c) The Geant4-DNA collaboration.

This examples shows how to compute proximity functions
in liquid water using exclusively Geant4-DNA
physics processes and models.

This example is provided by the Geant4-DNA collaboration.

These processes and models are further described at:
http://geant4-dna.org

Any report or published results obtained using the Geant4-DNA software shall 
cite the following Geant4-DNA collaboration publications:

- Med. Phys. 45  (2018) e722-e739

\section Examplemicroprox_s1 Geometry

An infinite box of liquid water.

\section Examplemicroprox_s2 Incident particles

Particles can be selected from the microprox.in macro
as well as their incident energy.
They are shot from the center of the box.
Tracking cut can also be selected (as energy).

\section Examplemicroprox_s3 Physics

The default Geant4-DNA physics constructor 2 is used in
the PhysicsList class. Alternative constructor can be
selected from microprox.in

\section Examplemicroprox_s4 Scoring of enery deposition

Energy depositions are scored in spherical shells from randomly selected hits.
The user can select the dimensions of the shells as well as radius steps in TrackerSD.cc.

\section Examplemicroprox_s5 Run

The code can be run using:
\verbatim
./microprox microprox.in
\endverbatim

\section Examplemicroprox_s6 Results

Results can be analyzed after the run using:
\verbatim
root plot.C
\endverbatim

The distribution of t is shown by default.
