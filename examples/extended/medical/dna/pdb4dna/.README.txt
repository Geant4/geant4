This example is provided by the Geant4-DNA collaboration.

These processes and models are further described at:
http://geant4-dna.org

Any report or published results obtained using the Geant4-DNA software shall

\section pdb4dna_s1 A brief description

The PDB4DNA example simulates energy deposits in a target volume generated from a PDB file representing DNA geometry.
Position of energy deposits are used to compute strand breaks in the DNA geometry.
Geant4-DNA processes are used. 

The example package contains:
- source files (src, include, pdb4dna.cc)
- README
- .in, analysis.C and visualization macro files
- 1ZBB.pdb (di nucleosome is loaded by default)

To run the example: see section 4 of this README
To analyze output: see section 6 of this README

\section pdb4dna_s2 Set-up

The geometry is a 1000 angstrom side cube (World) made of galactic material.
Before a computation, user loads a PDB file and generates a target volume (the bounding volume) of liquid water, which dimensions are extrapolated from PDB file atom 3D coordinates.

\section pdb4dna_s3 Some main features

\verbatim
| MESSENGER LIST |
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[1] Load a PDB file (The default atoms visualization is done by sphere that are parametrized with the van der Waals radius). \n
CPK coloring. \n
- Hydrogen(H) => white sphere,
- Carbon(C) => gray sphere,
- Oxygen(O) => red sphere,
- Nitrogen(N) => dark blue sphere,
- Sulfur(S) => yellow sphere,
- Phosphorus(P) => orange sphere,
- others/undefined => pink sphere. \n
/PDB4DNA/det/loadPDB filename.pdb
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[2] Build only a bounding volume for computation and draw it : \n
/PDB4DNA/det/buildBoundingV
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[3] Draw Atoms :  /PDB4DNA/det/drawAtoms \n
[4] Draw Nucleotids (sphere representing nucleotids) :  /PDB4DNA/det/drawNucleotides \n
[5] Draw Residues : /PDB4DNA/det/drawResidues \n
- Base => blue sphere,Sugar => yellow sphere,Phosphate => red sphere. \n
Spheres are linked by cylinders

[6] Draw Atoms with bounding volume : /PDB4DNA/det/drawAtomsWithBounding \n
[7] Draw Nucleotides with bounding volume : /PDB4DNA/det/drawNucleotidesWithBounding \n
[8] Draw Residues with bounding volume : /PDB4DNA/det/drawResiduesWithBounding \n
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[9] Set energy treshold to compute SSB : /PDB4DNA/event/setEnergyThres 8.22 eV (default value set to 8.22 eV) \n
[10] Set distance treshlod to compute DSB : /PDB4DNA/event/setDistanceThres 10    (default value set to 10) \n

Notes: \n
[1] is mandatory for visualization and simulation. \n
[2] is needed for simulation. \n

\section pdb4dna_s4 How to run the example.

To get help, run:

> ./pdb4dna(.exe) -h

In interactive mode, run:

> ./pdb4dna(.exe) -gui

"1ZBB.pdb" is the default file and it should be placed into same directory as the executable.
You can download it here: \n
http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/download/downloadFile.do?fileFormat=pdb&compression=NO&structureId=1ZBB

In batch mode , run:

> ./pdb4dna(.exe) [-mac pdb4dna.in] [-mt numberofThreads] \n

To get visualization, make sure to uncomment the #/control/execute vis.mac line in the macro.

\section pdb4dna_s5 The physics

 This example shows how to use the Geant4-DNA processes from constructor

Look at the PhyscisList.cc file.

\section pdb4dna_s6 Simulation output

The output results consists in a pdb.root file, containing for each event: \n
- the energy deposit in the bounding box (in electronVolt) \n
- the number of single strand break (SSB) \n
- the number of double strand break (DSB) \n

This file can be easily analyzed using for example the provided ROOT macro 
file analysis.C; to do so : \n
* be sure to have ROOT installed on your machine \n
* be sure to be in the example directory \n
* launch ROOT by typing root \n
* under your ROOT session, type in : .X analysis.C to execute the macro file \n
* alternatively you can type directly under your session : root analysis.C \n
