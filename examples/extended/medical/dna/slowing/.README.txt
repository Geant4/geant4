\section slowing_s1 INTRODUCTION.

The slowing example shows how to simulate slowing down spectra for electrons
in liquid water using the Geant4-DNA physics processes and models.

This example is provided by the Geant4-DNA collaboration.

It is described in Nucl. Instrum. and Meth. B 397 (2017) 45-50.

The Geant4-DNA processes and models are further described at:
http://geant4-dna.org

Any report or published results obtained using the Geant4-DNA software shall
cite the following Geant4-DNA collaboration publications:
Med. Phys. 45, (2018) e722-e739
Phys. Med. 31 (2015) 861-874
Med. Phys. 37 (2010) 4692-4708
Int. J. Model. Simul. Sci. Comput. 1 (2010) 157–178

\section slowing_s2 GEOMETRY SET-UP.

The geometry is a cube (World) made of liquid water (G4_WATER
material). Electrons are shot from the center of the volume.

\section slowing_s3 SET-UP

Make sure $G4LEDATA points to the low energy electromagnetic data files.

The code can be compiled with cmake.

It works in MT mode.

\section slowing_s4 HOW TO RUN THE EXAMPLE

In batch mode, run:

./slowing slowing.in

The macro slowing.in shows how to use/define:
- number of threads
- Geant4-DNA physics constructors
- tracking cut
- atomic deexcitation
- histograms

\section slowing_s5 PHYSICS

All Geant4-DNA physics constructors can be used.

\section slowing_s6 SIMULATION OUTPUT AND RESULT ANALYSIS

The output results consist in a slowing.root file containing 3 histograms
of slowing down spectrum Phi/D (unit is /cm2/eV/Gy) as a function of energy
(log (E/eV)) for:
- all electrons (histogram number 1)
- primary electrons (histogram number 2)
- secondary electrons (histogram number 3)

This file can be easily analyzed using the provided ROOT macro
file plot.C (root plot.C).
