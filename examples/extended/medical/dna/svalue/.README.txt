\section svalue_s1 INTRODUCTION.                                                    
                                                 
The svalue example shows how to calculate monoenergetic S values in liquid water
using the Geant4-DNA physics processes and models. 

It is adapted from TestEm12.

This example is provided by the Geant4-DNA collaboration.

These processes and models are further described at:
http://geant4-dna.org

Any report or published results obtained using the Geant4-DNA software shall 
cite the following Geant4-DNA collaboration publications:
Phys. Med. 31 (2015) 861-874
Med. Phys. 37 (2010) 4692-4708

\section svalue_s2 GEOMETRY SET-UP

The geometry is a 10-nm radius sphere of liquid water (G4_WATER
material). Particles are shot randomly inside the sphere. Surrounding
medium is not considered.

Radius of the sphere, particle type and energy can be controlled by the 
svalue.in macro file.

The PrimaryGeneratorAction class is adapted (G4 state dependent) 
in order to enable generic physics list usage 
(empty modular physics list).

\section svalue_s3 SET-UP 

Make sure G4LEDATA points to the low energy electromagnetic data files.

The code can be compiled with cmake.

It works in MT mode.

\section svalue_s4 HOW TO RUN THE EXAMPLE                                         

In interactive mode, run:

\verbatim
./svalue svalue.in
\endverbatim

The svalue.in macro allows a full control of the simulation.

\section svalue_s5 PHYSICS

You can select Geant4-DNA physics constructor in svalue.in.

A tracking cut can be applied if requested.

\section svalue_s6 SIMULATION OUTPUT AND RESULT ANALYSIS                                    

The output results consist in a text file (s.txt), containing :
- the radius of the sphere (in nm)
- the energy of incident particles (in eV)
- the S value (in Gy/Bq.s)
- the rms on S value (in Gy/Bq.s)

Note: rms values correspond to standard deviation.
