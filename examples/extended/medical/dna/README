This directory contains a set of Geant4-DNA examples.

   - dnaphysics 
       The dnaphysics example shows how to simulate track structures in liquid 
       water using the Geant4-DNA physics processes and models.

   - icsd
       This example shows how to use cross section models for DNA materials

   - mfp
       This example shows how to simulate mean free path in liquid water

   - microdosimetry 
       The microdosimetry example simulates the track of a 5 MeV proton in 
       liquid water. 
       Geant4 standard EM models are used in the World volume while Geant4-DNA 
       models are used in a Target volume, declared as a Region.

   - microyz 
       Simulation of microdosimetry spectra

   - range 
       Simulation of ranges.

   - slowing 
       Simulation of slowing down spectra.

   - spower 
       Simulation of stopping power.

   - svalue
       This example shows how to simulate S-values in spheres of liquid water
       using the Geant4-DNA physics processes and models.

   - wvalue
       This example shows how to simulate W-values in liquid water
       using the Geant4-DNA physics processes and models.

   - chem1   Simple activation of the chemistry module.
   - chem2   Usage of TimeStepAction in the chemistry module.
   - chem3   Activate the full interactivity with the chemistry module.
   - chem4   Simulation of radiochemical yields with the chemistry module.

   - pdb4dna         
       Usage of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) file format to build geometries.

   - wholeNuclearDNA 
       Geometrical description of a full simplified cell nucleus.
   
   - neuron 
       Irradiation of a realistic neuron cell.
   
   - clustering 
       Clustering application for direct damage extraction.
   
See the README page inside each example for more detail.
