    -- General info --
    The G-values are computing for a range of deposited energy [A;B].
    We are in an infinite volume. Therefore the energy lost by the
    primary equals the deposited energy since all secondary particles
    will finally slow down to the thermal energy.
    The primary is killed once it has deposited more energy than the
    minimum threshold A.
    However, when the particle looses more energy in few interaction
    steps than the maximum allowed thresold B, the event is
    disregarded (=aborted).

    Note that if the upper boundary of the energy lost by the primary is
    not set, the chemistry may take a lot of time to compute.

- Abort event if the energy lost by the primary is larger than a
user chosen threshold
- Update README and .README.txt for new UI commands
