This example is provided by the Geant4-DNA collaboration.
(http://geant4-dna.org)

Any report or published results obtained using the Geant4-DNA software shall 
cite the following Geant4-DNA collaboration publications: \n

The example shows how to activate the chemistry code and score the radiochemical yield G
defined as \n
\verbatim
(Number of species X) / (100 eV of deposited energy).
\endverbatim
in a range of deposited energy [X;Y] chosen by the user.\n

\section CHEM4_s1 GEOMETRY DEFINITION
The world volume is a simple box which represents a 'pseudo infinite'
homogeneous medium.

Two parameters define the geometry :
- the material of the box -- for Geant4-DNA it has to be water.
- the full size of the box.

The default geometry is constructed in DetectorConstruction class.

\section CHEM4_s2 PHYSICS LIST

  PhysicsList is Geant4 modular physics list using G4EmDNAPhysics &
  G4EmDNAChemistry constructors.
  It will later be updated to use the G4EmDNAModelActivator constructor

\section CHEM4_s3  ACTION INITALIZATION

  The class ActionInitialization instantiates and registers
  to Geant4 kernel all user action classes.

  While in sequential mode the action classes are instantiated just once,
  via invoking the method
    ActionInitialization::Build()
  in multi-threading mode the same method is invoked for each thread worker
  and so all user action classes are defined thread-local.

  A run action class is instantiated both thread-local
  and global that's why its instance is created also in the method
    ActionInitialization::BuildForMaster()
  which is invoked only in multi-threading mode.

\section CHEM4_s4 AN EVENT: PRIMARY GENERATOR

  The primary kinematic consists of a single particle starting at the center
   of the box. The type of the particle and its energy are set in the
  PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can be changed via the G4 build-in
  commands of G4ParticleGun class.
  The chemistry module is triggered in the StackingAction class when all
  physical tracks have been processed.

\section CHEM4_s5 DETECTOR RESPONSE : Scorers

\subsection CHEM4_s5_sub1 Species scorer

  Scorers are defined in DetectorConstruction::ConstructSDandField(). There is
  one G4MultiFunctionalDetector object which computes the energy deposition and
  the number of species along time in order to extract
  the radiochemical yields:
\verbatim
(Number of species X) / (100 eV of deposited energy).
\endverbatim

  Run::RecordEvent(), called at end of event, collects informations
  event per event from the hits collections, and accumulates statistic for
  RunAction::EndOfRunAction().

  In multi-threading mode the statistics accumulated per workers is merged
  to the master in Run::Merge().

  The information about all the molecular species is scored in a ROOT
  ntuple file Species.root. The root macro program PlotNtuple.C can be used to
  plot the G values vs time, for each species.
  
\subsection CHEM4_s5_sub2 Primary Killer
  The G-values are computing for a range of deposited energy. 
  We are in an infinite volume. Therefore the energy lost by the 
  primary equals the deposited energy since all secondary particles 
  will finally slow down to the thermal energy. 
  The primary is killed once it has deposited more energy than a 
  minimum threshold. 
  IMPORTANT: However, when the primary particle looses more energy in 
  few interaction steps than the maximum allowed thresold, the event is 
  disregarded (=aborted). \n
  
  These two macro commands can be used to control the energy loss by the primary:
  
\verbatim
/primaryKiller/eLossMin 1 keV 
# after 1 keV of energy loss by the primary particle, the primary is killed

/primaryKiller/eLossMax 2 keV 
# if the primary particle losses more than 2 keV, the event is aborted
\endverbatim

  The G-values are then computed for a deposited energy in the range [1 keV;2 keV].

  Note that if the upper boundary of the energy lost by the primary is not set, the chemistry may 
  take a lot of time to compute as the number of secondaries may be huge.
  This set of macros is embedded in the PrimaryKiller class.
  The species scorer must check whether the event was aborted before taking it or not into
  account for the computation of the results. 

\section CHEM4_s6 STACKING ACTION

  StackingAction::NewStage is called when a stack of tracks has been processed
  (for more details, look at the Geant4 documentation).
  A verification on whether physical tracks remain to be processed is done.
  If no tracks remain to be processed, the chemical module is then triggered.

\section CHEM4_s7 VISUALISATION

  The visualization manager is set via the G4VisExecutive class
  in the main() function in chem4.cc.
  The initialisation of the drawing is done via a set of /vis/ commands
  in the macro vis.mac. To activate the visualization mode run:
\verbatim
./chem4 -vis
\endverbatim

\section CHEM4_s8 OUTPUT

  Physics initialization and the defined reaction table are printed.
  G4Scheduler processes the chemical stage time step after time step.
  Chemical reactions are printed.
    The molecular reaction as a function of the elapsed time can be displayed
   setting the macro command /scheduler/verbose 1
   
\section CHEM4_s9 RELEVANT MACRO COMMANDS
\verbatim
/primaryKiller/eLoss 1 keV       # after 1 keV of energy loss by the primary particle, the primary is killed
/scheduler/verbose 1             # set the verbose level of the G4Scheduler class (time steps, reactions ...)
/scheduler/endTime 1 microsecond # set the time at which the simulation stops
/scheduler/whyDoYouStop          # for advanced users: print information at the end of the chemical stage 
                                 # to know why the simulation has stopped
\endverbatim

\section CHEM4_s10 PLOT
  The information about all the molecular species is scored in a ROOT
  ntuple file Species.root during the run of chem4.
  The ROOT program plotG can be used to plot the G values vs time, 
  for each species. It must be launched after 
  chem4 has run. When "plotG" is executed, select the root file output by the 
  chem4 application.
  You can also execute plotG as: 
\verbatim
./plot/plotG Species.root 
\endverbatim
  where Species.root is the file output by the chem4 application.
  
\section CHEM4_s11 OTHER INFORMATION
  I have access to a track. How do I access to its molecular information?
\verbatim
#include "G4Molecule.hh"
G4Track* thisIsMytrack = ...
G4Molecule* thisIsMyMolecule = GetMolecule(thisIsMyTrack);
\endverbatim
 If the pointer thisIsMyMolecule is null, then this is NOT a chemical species 

  How do I get the molecule's name?
\verbatim
G4Molecule* thisIsMyMolecule = ...
const G4String& moleculeName = thisIsMyMolecule->GetName();
\endverbatim

How can I display the reaction information?
 - Use this macro command: 
\verbatim
/scheduler/verbose 1
\endverbatim

How can I display the step by step information?
 1. Add ITTrackingInteraction to the G4Scheduler singleton (cf. chem3)
 2. Use  
\verbatim
/chem/tracking/verbose 1
\endverbatim
