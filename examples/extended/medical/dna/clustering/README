This example is provided by the Geant4-DNA collaboration.

These processes and models are further described at:

---> 1. Introduction

The clustering example simulates protons tracks in liquid water using Geant4-DNA processes and models.
Energy deposit are clustered with a dedicated clustering algorithm to assess strand breaks.
The default parameters of the clustering algorithm have been tuned to reproduce data published by
Francis et al. 2011 Comput. Meth. Programs. Biomed. 2011 101(3)

----> 2. Set-up

It is similar to the geometry set-up proposed in Francis et al. 2011 Comput. Meth. Programs. Biomed. 2011 101(3).
It consists in a World volume containing a Target box made of liquid water of  1µm x 1µm x 0.5 µm.
Energy deposits in the Target are registered (see SteppingAction.cc) and the clustering algorithm is run at the end of each event
(see EventAction.cc)

----> 3. How to run the example

To get help, run:

> ./clustering -h

In interactive mode, run:

> ./clustering -gui

In batch mode , run:

> ./clustering [-mac run.in] [-mt numberofThreads]

Two macros are available:

run.in: shoots 1000 protons of 500 keV

runOneEvent.in: shoots one proton of 500 keV

All UI clustering commands in these macros are described below in section 5.

----> 4. Simulation output 

The output results consists in a clusters_output.root file, containing for each event:
- the number of single strand break
- the number of complex single strand break
- the number of double strand break
- the cluster size distribution
- the absorbed dose in the Target

----> 5. More information

Specific classes are available in this example:

* ClusteringAlgo: contains the core clustering algorithm

* ClusteringAlgoMessenger: defines all UI commands to tune 
the clustering algorithm

/clustering/algo/setMinPts: 
  Minimal number of points to create a cluster

/clustering/algo/setSelectionProb: 
  Probability to select potential damage according to the geometry

/clustering/algo/setEps: 
  Maximal distance between points to create a cluster

/clustering/algo/setEmin: 
  Energy to have a probability to create a strand break = 0

/clustering/algo/setEmax: 
  Energy to have a probability to create a strand break = 1
allow
* ClusterSBPoints: defines a cluster of strand break points

* CommandLineParser: defines a parser for command line control
as in other Geant4-DNA examples

* RunInitObserver: allows initializations at new run 
(as in pdb4dna and microdosimetry)

* SBPoint: defines a class for point of energy deposition
