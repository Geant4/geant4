---->0. INTRODUCTION.

The mfp example shows how to calculate mean free path of particles
in liquid water using the Geant4-DNA physics processes and models.

It has been adapted from the spower and TestEm14 examples.

This example is provided by the Geant4-DNA collaboration.

The Geant4-DNA processes and models are further described at:
http://geant4-dna.org

Any report or published results obtained using the Geant4-DNA software shall
cite the following Geant4-DNA collaboration publications:

---->1. GEOMETRY SET-UP.

The geometry is a 1 m radius sphere of liquid water (G4_WATER
material). Particles are shot along x from the sphere centre.

Radius of the sphere, physics constructor, primary particle type and
energy can be controlled by the mfp.in macro file.

---->2. SET-UP

Make sure G4LEDATA points to the low energy electromagnetic data files.

The code can be compiled with cmake.

It works in MT mode.

---->3. HOW TO RUN THE EXAMPLE

Use:

./mfp mfp.in

The mfp.in macro allows a full control of the simulation.

The computation of MFP and other quantities is performed in the
SteppingAction::UserSteppingAction method.

The histo.in macro shows how to display several quantities
(energy spectrum, scattering angle along x) of primary and secondaries.

---->4. PHYSICS

G4EmDNAPhysics* constructors are used.

---->5. SIMULATION OUTPUT AND RESULT ANALYSIS

The output results consist in a text file (mfp.txt), containing:
- energy of incident particles (in eV)
- mfp (in nm)
- rms (i.e. standard deviation) on mfp (in nm)

Otherwise you may use histo.in to generate ROOT histograms of the
other quantities.
