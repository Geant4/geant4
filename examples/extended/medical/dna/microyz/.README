(c) The Geant4-DNA collaboration.

This examples shows how to compute microdosimetry 
distributions y, z in liquid water using exclusively Geant4-DNA
physics processes and models.

This example is provided by the Geant4-DNA collaboration.

These processes and models are further described at:
http://geant4-dna.org

Any report or published results obtained using the Geant4-DNA software shall 
cite the following Geant4-DNA collaboration publications:
Phys. Med. 31 (2015) 861-874
Med. Phys. 37 (2010) 4692-4708
J. Appl. Phys. 122 (2017) 024303

\section Examplemicroyz_s1 Geometry

A box of liquid water.

\section Examplemicroyz_s2 Incident particles

Particles can be selected from the mycroyz.in macro
as well as their incident energy.
They are shot from the center of the box.

\section Examplemicroyz_s3 Physics

The default Geant4-DNA physics constructor 2 is used in
the PhysicsList class. Alternative constructor can be
selected from microyz.in

\section Examplemicroyz_s4 Scoring of enery deposition

Energy depositions are scored in spheres randomly
placed along the incident particle track, 
using a weighted sampling.

The user can select in the TrackerSD class 
the radius of the sphere (5 nm by default)

\section Examplemicroyz_s5 Run

The code can be run using:
\verbatim
./microyz microyz.in
\endverbatim

\section Examplemicroyz_s6 Results

Results can be analyzed after the run using:
\verbatim
root plot.C
\endverbatim

The distribution of y is shown by default.

The following quantities are calculated: yF and yD.
