(c) The Geant4-DNA collaboration.

This examples shows how to compute microdosimetry
distributions y, z in liquid water using exclusively Geant4-DNA
physics processes and models.

This example is provided by the Geant4-DNA collaboration.

These processes and models are further described at:
http://geant4-dna.org
and in
J. Appl. Phys. 122 (2017) 024303

Any report or published results obtained using the Geant4-DNA software shall

\section Examplemicroyz_s1 Geometry

A box of liquid water.

\section Examplemicroyz_s2 Incident particles

Particles can be selected from the mycroyz.in macro
as well as their incident energy.
They are shot from the center of the box.

\section Examplemicroyz_s3 Physics

The default Geant4-DNA physics constructor 2 is used in
the PhysicsList class. Alternative constructor can be
selected from the macro file microyz.in.

Livermore and Penelope physics lists can be used as well.

Tracking cut and maximum step size can be selected in microyz.in

\section Examplemicroyz_s4 Scoring of enery deposition

Energy depositions are scored in spheres randomly
placed along the incident particle track,
using a weighted sampling.

The user can select the radius of the sphere in microyz.in using the command:
\verbatim
/microyz/det/Radius X unit
\endverbatim
where X is the radius value and unit is specified.

\section Examplemicroyz_s5 Run

The code can be run using:
\verbatim
./microyz microyz.in
\endverbatim

\section Examplemicroyz_s6 Results

Results can be analyzed after the run using:
\verbatim
root plot.C
\endverbatim

The distribution of y is shown by default.

The following quantities are calculated: yF and yD.
