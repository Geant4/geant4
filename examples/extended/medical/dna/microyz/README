This examples shows how to compute microdosimetry 
distributions in liquid water using exclusively Geant4-DNA
physics processes and models.

1) Geometry
A box of liquid water.

2) Incident particles
Particles can be selected from the mycroyz.in macro
as well as their incident energy.
They are shot from the center of the box.

3) Physics
The default Geant4-DNA physics constructor 2 is used in
<<<<<<< HEAD
the PhysicsList class.
=======
the PhysicsList class. Alternative constructor can be
selected from microyz.in.

Livermore and Penelope physics lists can be used as well.

Tracking cut and maximum step size can be selected in the macro
 file microyz.in

4) Scoring of enery deposition
Energy depositions are scored in spheres randomly
along the incident particle track.

The user can select in the TrackerSD class:

1- the number of samplings (1000 by default)

2- the radius of the sphere (1.5 um by default)

5) The code can be run using:
./microyz microyz.in

6) Results can be analyzed after the run using:
root plot.C

The following microdosimetry quantities are plotted

- f(y) 

- yf(y)

- d(y)

- yd(y)

y is expressed in keV/um

Plots are shown in lin-lin and log-lin coordinates.

The following quantities are calculated:

- Integral of f(y)dy

- yF (in keV/um)

- Integral of d(y)dy

- yD (in keV/um)

for linear lin-lin and log-lin plots, including normalization in the latter case.
