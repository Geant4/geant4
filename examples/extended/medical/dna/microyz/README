This examples shows how to compute microdosimetry 
distributions y, z in liquid water using exclusively Geant4-DNA
physics processes and models.

This example is provided by the Geant4-DNA collaboration.

These processes and models are further described at:
http://geant4-dna.org

Any report or published results obtained using the Geant4-DNA software shall 
cite the following Geant4-DNA collaboration publications:
Phys. Med. 31 (2015) 861-874
Med. Phys. 37 (2010) 4692-4708
J. Appl. Phys. 122 (2017) 024303

1) Geometry
A box of liquid water.

2) Incident particles
Particles can be selected from the mycroyz.in macro
as well as their incident energy.
They are shot from the center of the box.

3) Physics
The default Geant4-DNA physics constructor 2 is used in
the PhysicsList class. Alternative constructor can be
selected from microyz.in

4) Scoring of enery deposition
Energy depositions are scored in spheres randomly
placed along the incident particle track, 
using a weighted sampling.

The user can select in the TrackerSD class the radius
of the sphere (5 nm by default).

5) The code can be run using:
./microyz microyz.in

6) Results can be analyzed after the run using:
root plot.C

The distribution of y is shown by default.

The following quantities are calculated: yF and yD.
