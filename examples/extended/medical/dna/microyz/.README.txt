(c) The Geant4-DNA collaboration.

This example is provided by the Geant4-DNA collaboration.

These processes and models are further described at:
http://geant4-dna.org

Any report or published results obtained using the Geant4-DNA software shall 
cite the following Geant4-DNA collaboration publications: \n

This examples shows how to compute microdosimetry 
distributions in liquid water using exclusively Geant4-DNA
physics processes and models.

\section Examplemicroyz_s1 Geometry

A box of liquid water.

\section Examplemicroyz_s2 Incident particles

Particles can be selected from the mycroyz.in macro
as well as their incident energy.
They are shot from the center of the box.

\section Examplemicroyz_s3 Physics

The default Geant4-DNA physics constructor 2 is used in
the PhysicsList class.

\section Examplemicroyz_s4 Scoring of enery deposition

Energy depositions are scored in spheres randomly
along the incident particle track.

The user can select in the TrackerSD class:

- the number of samplings (100 by default)
- the radius of the sphere (1.5 um by default)

\section Examplemicroyz_s5 Run

The code can be run using:
\verbatim
./microyz microyz.in
\endverbatim

\section Examplemicroyz_s6 Results

Results can be analyzed after the run using:
\verbatim
root plot.C
\endverbatim

The following microdosimetry quantities are plotted

- f(y) 

- yf(y)

- d(y)

- yd(y)

y is expressed in keV/um

Plots are shown in lin-lin and log-lin coordinates.

The following quantities are calculated:

- Integral of f(y)dy

- yF (in keV/um)

- Integral of d(y)dy

- yD (in keV/um)

for linear lin-lin and log-lin plots, including normalization in the latter case.
