\section spower_s1 INTRODUCTION.                                                    
                                                 
The spower example shows how to calculate stopping power of particles 
in liquid water using the Geant4-DNA physics processes and models. 

This example is provided by the Geant4-DNA collaboration.

These processes and models are further described at:
http://geant4-dna.org

Any report or published results obtained using the Geant4-DNA software 
shall cite the following Geant4-DNA collaboration publications:
Phys. Med. 31 (2015) 861-874
Med. Phys. 37 (2010) 4692-4708

and for this example:
Nucl. Instrum. Meth. B 397 (2017) 45-50.

\section spower_s2 GEOMETRY SET-UP

The geometry is a 1 m radius sphere of liquid water (G4_WATER
material). Particles are shot randomly from the sphere centre.

Radius of the sphere, physics constructor, primary particle and 
energy can be controlled by the spower.in macro file.

The PrimaryGeneratorAction class is adapted (G4 state dependent) 
in order to enable generic physics list usage 
(empty modular physics list).

\section spower_s3 SET-UP 

Make sure G4LEDATA points to the low energy electromagnetic data files.

The code can be compiled with cmake.

It works in MT mode.

\section spower_s4 HOW TO RUN THE EXAMPLE                                         

In interactive mode, run:

\verbatim
./spower spower.in
\endverbatim

The spower.in macro allows a full control of the simulation.

The computation of stopping power is performed in the 
SteppingAction::UserSteppingAction method.

\section spower_s5 PHYSICS

Specific physics constructors, called G4EmDNAPhysics_stationary*
and adapted from G4EmDNAPhysics* are available to set all inelastic
models in a stationary mode for the computation of the stopping
power.

\section spower_s6 SIMULATION OUTPUT AND RESULT ANALYSIS                                    

The accuracy of results may depend on incident statistics as well as
on number of steps specified in the SteppingAction::UserSteppingAction 
method.

The output results consist in a text file (spower.txt), containing :
- energy of incident particles (in eV)
- stopping power (in keV/um)
- rms (i.e. standard deviation) on stopping power (in keV/um)
