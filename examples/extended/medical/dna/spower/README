---->0. INTRODUCTION.

The spower example shows how to calculate stopping power of particles
in liquid water using the Geant4-DNA physics processes and models.

This example is provided by the Geant4-DNA collaboration.

These processes and models are further described at:
http://geant4-dna.org

Any report or published results obtained using the Geant4-DNA software shall
cite the following Geant4-DNA collaboration publications:

---->1. GEOMETRY SET-UP.

The geometry is a 1 m radius sphere of liquid water (G4_WATER
material). Particles are shot randomly from the sphere centre.

Radius of the sphere, physics constructor, primary particle and
energy can be controlled by the spower.in macro file.

---->2. SET-UP

Make sure G4LEDATA points to the low energy electromagnetic data files.

The code can be compiled with cmake.

It works in MT mode.

---->3. HOW TO RUN THE EXAMPLE

In interactive mode, run:

./spower spower.in

The spower.in macro allows a full control of the simulation.

The computation of stopping power is performed in the
SteppingAction::UserSteppingAction method.

---->4. PHYSICS

Specific physics constructors, called G4EmDNAPhysics_stationary*
and adapted from G4EmDNAPhysics* are available to set all inelastic
models in a stationary mode for the computation of the stopping
power.

---->5. SIMULATION OUTPUT AND RESULT ANALYSIS

The accuracy of results may depend on incident statistics as well as
on number of steps specified in the SteppingAction::UserSteppingAction
method.

The output results consist in a text file (spower.txt), containing :
- energy of incident particles (in eV)
- stopping power (in keV/um)
- rms (i.e. standard deviation) on stopping power (in keV/um)
