\section dnaphysics_s1 INTRODUCTION.                                                    
                                                                       
The dnaphysics example shows how to simulate track structures in liquid water
using the Geant4-DNA physics processes and models. 

This example is provided by the Geant4-DNA collaboration.

These processes and models are further described at:
http://geant4-dna.org

Any report or published results obtained using the Geant4-DNA software shall 
cite the following Geant4-DNA collaboration publications: \n
Phys. Med. 31 (2015) 861-874
Med. Phys. 37 (2010) 4692-4708 \n

\section dnaphysics_s2 GEOMETRY SET-UP
 
The geometry is a 100-micron side cube (World) made of liquid water (G4_WATER
material). Particles are shot from the center of the volume.

The variable density feature of materials is illustrated. 
Material can be changed directly in dna.mac macro file.

\section dnaphysics_s3 SET-UP 
                                                                        
Make sure G4LEDATA points to the low energy electromagnetic data files.

The code can be compiled with cmake.

It works in MT mode.

\section dnaphysics_s4 HOW TO RUN THE EXAMPLE                                         

In interactive mode, run:

\verbatim
./dnaphysics
\endverbatim

The macro dna.mac is executed by default. It shows how to shoot different 
particle types.

To get visualization, make sure to uncomment the #/control/execute vis.mac
 line in the macro (not recommended).

\section dnaphysics_s5 PHYSICS

This example shows:
- how to use the Geant4-DNA processes, which are activated automatically at low energy,
below the applicability range of G4EmStandardPhysics_option4 constructor
(look at the PhysicsList.cc file)
- how to count and save occurrences of processes
(look at the SteppingAction.cc file)

Alternatively, the direct usage of Geant4-DNA physics constructors is also shown 
in comment in the PhysicsList.cc file.

\section dnaphysics_s6 SIMULATION OUTPUT AND RESULT ANALYSIS                                    

The output results consists in a dna.root file, containing for each simulation step:
- the type of particle for the current step
- the type of process for the current step
- the track position of the current step (in nanometers)
- the energy deposit along the current step (in eV)
- the step length (in nm)
- the total energy loss along the current step (in eV)
- the kinetic energy at PreStepPoint
- the cos of the scattering angle
- the event ID
- the track ID
- the parent track ID
- the step number

This file can be easily analyzed using for example the provided ROOT macro 
file plot.C; to do so :
* be sure to have ROOT installed on your machine
* be sure to be in the directory containing the ROOT files created by dnaphysics
* copy plot.C into this directory
* from there, launch ROOT by typing root
* under your ROOT session, type in : .X plot.C to execute the macro file
* alternatively you can type directly under your session : root plot.C

The naming scheme on the displayed ROOT plots is as follows (see SteppingAction.cc):

This is the same naming scheme as in the "microdosimetry" advanced example.
