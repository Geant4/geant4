---->0. INTRODUCTION

The dnaphysics example shows how to simulate track structures in liquid water
using the Geant4-DNA physics processes and models.

The Geant4-DNA processes and models are further described at:
http://geant4-dna.org

Any report or published results obtained using the Geant4-DNA software shall
cite the following Geant4-DNA collaboration publications:
Med. Phys. 51 (2024) 5873–5889
Med. Phys. 45 (2018) e722-e739
Phys. Med. 31 (2015) 861-874

---->1. GEOMETRY SET-UP

The geometry is a 100-micron side cube (World) made of liquid water (G4_WATER
material). Particles are shot from the center of the volume. The World size
can be changed directly in the dnaphysics.in macro file.

The variable density feature of materials is illustrated in DetectorConstruction.
The material density can be changed directly in the dnaphysics.in macro file.

---->2. SET-UP

Make sure $G4LEDATA points to the low energy electromagnetic data files.

---->3. HOW TO RUN THE EXAMPLE

In interactive mode, run:

./dnaphysics

In batch, the macro dnaphysics.in can be used. It shows how to shoot different
particle types and how to use Geant4-DNA Physics constructors.

The deexcitation.in macro can also be used to simulate the energy spectrum of deexcitation products.

---->4. PHYSICS

The PhysicsList uses Geant4-DNA Physics constructors and other
electromagnetic physics constructors.

Geant4-DNA Physics constructors can be selected using the command:

/dna/test/addPhysics DNA_OptX

where X is 0 to 8 (2, 4 or 6 are recommended).

In addition, to also enable radioactive decay, one can use:

/dna/test/addPhysics raddecay

Warning regarding ions: when the incident particle type is ion
(/gun/particle ion), specified with Z and A numbers (/gun/ion A Z),
the Rudd ionisation extended model is used. The particles are tracked
by default down to 0.5 MeV/u and undergo below a capture process.
This tracking cut can be bypassed using:

/dna/test/addIonsTrackingCut false

---->5. SIMULATION OUTPUT AND RESULT ANALYSIS

The output results consists in a dna.root file, containing two ntuples, named
"step" and "track", respectively:

1) for each simulation step:

- the type of particle for the current step
- the type of process for the current step
- the step PostStepPoint coordinates (in nm)
- the energy deposit along the current step (in eV)
- the step length (in nm)
- the total energy loss along the current step (in eV)
- the kinetic energy at PreStepPoint (in eV)
- the cos of the scattering angle
- the event ID
- the track ID
- the parent track ID
- the step number

This information is extracted from the SteppingAction class.

The ROOT file can be easily analyzed using for example the provided ROOT macro
file plot.C; to do so :
* be sure to have ROOT installed on your machine
* be sure to be in the directory containing the ROOT files created by dnaphysics
* copy plot.C into this directory
* from there, launch ROOT by typing root
* under your ROOT session, type in : .X plot.C to execute the macro file
* alternatively you can type directly under your session : root plot.C

Also, the plotDeexcitation.C ROOT macro file can be used to plot results of deexcitation.in.

The naming scheme on the displayed ROOT plots is as follows (see SteppingAction.cc):
