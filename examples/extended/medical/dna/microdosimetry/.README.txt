\section microdosimetry_s1  INTRODUCTION                                                   
                                                                       
The microdosimetry example simulates the track of two 5 MeV protons in liquid water. 
Geant4 standard EM models are used in the World volume while Geant4-DNA models
are used in a Target volume, declared as a Region.

This example is provided by the Geant4-DNA collaboration. 

These processes and models are further described at:
http://geant4-dna.org

Any report or published results obtained using the Geant4-DNA software shall 
cite the following Geant4-DNA collaboration publications: \n
Phys. Med. 31 (2015) 861-874
Med. Phys. 37 (2010) 4692-4708

\section microdosimetry_s2 GEOMETRY SET-UP
 
The geometry is a 1 mm side cube (World) made of liquid water containing a smaller cubic Target volume of liquid
water, which dimensions are twenty times smaller than the dimensions of the World volume.

\section microdosimetry_s3 SET-UP 
                                                                        
Make sure G4LEDATA points to the low energy electromagnetic libraries.

The code can be compiled with cmake.

It works in MT mode.

\section microdosimetry_s4 HOW TO RUN THE EXAMPLE                                         
Normal mode, run:

\verbatim
./microdosimetry -mt 2 -out microdosimetry
\endverbatim

(or more generally
\verbatim
./microdosimetry -mt 2 -out myRootFile
\endverbatim
)

The macro microdosimetry.in is executed by default; to select another one:

\verbatim
./microdosimetry -mac myMacro.mac
\endverbatim

To get visualization and interactivity:

\verbatim
./microdosimetry -gui
\endverbatim
( OGL used by default)

or you may use your own visualization driver, for instance:
\verbatim
./microdosimetry -vis "DAWNFILE"
\endverbatim

\section microdosimetry_s5 PHYSICS

This example shows:
- how to use the Geant4-DNA processes, 
- how to count and save occurrences of processes
- how to combine them with Standard EM Physics.

A simple electron capture process is also provided in order to kill electrons 
below a chosen energy threshold, set in the Physics list.

Look at the PhyscisList.cc file.

\section microdosimetry_s6 SIMULATION OUTPUT AND RESULT ANALYSIS                                    

The output results consists in a microdosimetry.root file, containing for each simulation step:
- the type of particle for the current step
- the type of process for the current step
- the track position of the current step (in nanometers)
- the energy deposit along the current step (in eV)
- the step length (in nm)
- the total enery loss along the current step (in eV)

This file can be easily analyzed using for example the provided ROOT macro 
file plot.C; to do so :
* be sure to have ROOT installed on your machine
* be sure to be in the microdosimetry directory
* launch ROOT by typing root
* under your ROOT session, type in : .X plot.C to execute the macro file
* alternatively you can type directly under your session : root plot.C

The naming scheme on the displayed ROOT plots is as follows (see SteppingAction.cc):

e-       : 1 \n
