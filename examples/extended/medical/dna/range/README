---->0. INTRODUCTION.                                                    
                                                                       
The range example shows how to calculate range of electrons 
in liquid water using the Geant4-DNA physics processes and models. 

It is adapted from svalue.

This example is provided by the Geant4-DNA collaboration.

These processes and models are further described at:
http://geant4-dna.org

Any report or published results obtained using the Geant4-DNA software shall 
cite the following Geant4-DNA collaboration publications:
Phys. Med. 31 (2015) 861-874
Med. Phys. 37 (2010) 4692-4708

---->1. GEOMETRY SET-UP.
 
The geometry is a 1 m radius sphere of liquid water (G4_WATER
material). Particles are shot randomly from the sphere centre.

Radius of the sphere, physics constructor and energy can be 
controlled by the range.in macro file.

The PrimaryGeneratorAction class is adapted (G4 state dependent) 
in order to enable generic physics list usage 
(empty modular physics list).

---->2. SET-UP 
                                                                        
Make sure G4LEDATA points to the low energy electromagnetic data files.

The code can be compiled with cmake.

It works in MT mode.

---->3. HOW TO RUN THE EXAMPLE                                         

In interactive mode, run:

./range range.in

The range.in macro allows a full control of the simulation.

The histo.in macro is also provided for the creation of histograms.

The computation of ranges is performed in the 
TrackingAction::PostUserTrackingAction method. The computation 
for electrons uses the primary particle track length and the computation 
for incident particles undergoing Geant4-DNA charge exchange processes, such
as protons, hydrogen, alpha particles and their charge states, is specific.

---->4. PHYSICS

You can select Geant4-DNA physics constructor in range.in.

A tracking cut can be applied if requested.

---->5. SIMULATION OUTPUT AND RESULT ANALYSIS                                    

The output results consist in a text file (range.txt), containing :
- energy of incident particles (in eV)
- track length of primary particle (in nm)
- rms of track length of primary particle (in nm)
- projected length of primary particle (in nm)
- rms of projected length of primary particle (in nm)
- penetration of primary particle (in nm)
- rms of penetration of primary particle (in nm)

Note: rms values correspond to standard deviation.

Results in this file can be displayed using the ROOT macro plot.C:
root plot.C
