 This program computes the dose deposited in an ionization chamber by an
 extended (one dimensional) monoenergetic electron source.
 The geometry of the chamber satisfies the conditions of charged particle
 equilibrium. Hence, under idealized conditions, the ratio of the dose 
 deposited over the beam energy fluence must be equal to 1.
 This variante of the Fano cavity test make use of an reciprocity theorem.

\section ExamplefanoCavity2_s1 GEOMETRY
 
 The chamber is modelized as a cylinder with a cavity in it.
 
 5 parameters define the geometry :
   - the radius of the chamber (must be big)
   - the material of the wall
   - the thickness of the wall
   - the material of the cavity
   - the thickness of the cavity

 Wall and cavity must be made of the same material, but with different
 density.
 Radius must be bigger than range of electrons in cavity.
 
 All above parameters can be redifined via the UI commands built in 
 DetectorMessenger class.

\section ExamplefanoCavity2_s2 BEAM
 
 Monoenergetic (E0) incident electron source is uniformly distribued along
 cylinder axis, within wall and cavity, with constant lineic density
 per mass: I.
 An effective wall thickness is defined from the range of e- at energy E0.
 
 Beam_energy_fluence is E0*I
 
\section ExamplefanoCavity2_s3 PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM
 
 The program computes the dose deposited in the cavity and the ratio
 Dose/Beam_energy_fluence. This ratio must be 1.
 
 The program needs high statistic to reach precision on the computed dose.
 The UI command /run/printProgress allows to survey the convergence of
 the dose calculation.
 
 The simplest way to study the effect of e- tracking parameters on dose 
 deposition is to use the command /testem/stepMax.
 
\section ExamplefanoCavity2_s4 PHYSICS
 
 The physics list contains the standard electromagnetic processes, with few 
 modifications listed here.
 
 - Bremsstrahlung : Fano conditions imply no energy transfer via
 bremsstrahlung radiation. Therefore this process is not registered in the
 physics list. However, it is always possible to include it. 
 See PhysListEm classes.
 
 - Ionization : In order to have same stopping power in wall and cavity, one
 must cancel the density correction term in the dedx formula. This is done in
 a specific MollerBhabha model (MyMollerBhabhaModel) which inherites from 
 G4MollerBhabhaModel.
 \n\n
 To prevent explicit generation of delta-rays, the default production
 threshold (i.e. cut) is set to 10 km (CSDA condition).
 \n\n
 The finalRange of the step function is set to 10 um, which more on less
 correspond to a tracking cut in water of about 20 keV. See emOptions.
 Once again, the above parameters can be controled via UI commands.
 
 - Multiple scattering : is switched in single Coulomb scattering mode near
 boundaries. This is selected via EM options in PhysicsList, and can be
 controled with UI commands.
 
 - All PhysicsTables are built with 100 bins per decade.  
 
\section ExamplefanoCavity2_s5 HISTOGRAMS
 
   fanoCavity2 has several predefined 1D histograms : 
   - 1 : emission point of e+-
   - 2 : energy spectrum of e+-
   - 3 : theta distribution of e+-
   - 4 : emission point of e+- hitting cavity
   - 5 : energy spectrum of e+- when entering in cavity
   - 6 : theta distribution of e+- before enter in cavity
   - 7 : theta distribution of e+- at first step in cavity      
   - 8 : track segment of e+- in cavity
   - 9 : step size of e+- in wall
   - 10 : step size of e+- in cavity
   - 11 : energy deposit in cavity per track
 
   The histograms are managed by G4AnalysisManager class and its Messenger. 
   The histos can be individually activated with the command :
\verbatim
/analysis/h1/set id nbBins  valMin valMax unit 
\endverbatim
   where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, deg or mrad, etc..)
   
   One can control the name of the histograms file with the command:
\verbatim
/analysis/setFileName  name  (default fanocavity2)
\endverbatim
   
   It is possible to choose the format of the histogram file :
   root(default), xml, hbook.  See HistoManager.hh
      
   It is also possible to print selected histograms on an ascii file:
\verbatim
/analysis/h1/setAscii id
\endverbatim
   All selected histos will be written on a file name.ascii 
   (default fanocavity2)
