Electron beam of 50 MeV converted on target. All charged particles removed
from the beam after the target. Gamma beam irradiate a water phantom.
In front of the phantom a thin CheckVolume is placed to score gamma
beam properties. Inside the phantom a score volume is placed to calculate 
radial radiation dose distribution.


\section ExampleGammaTherapy_s1 GEOMETRY


GammaTherapy application geometry consists of along z:

-# Generator of electrons directed along z-axis
-# Target1 (Be, W)
-# Target2 (W, Cu)
-# GasVolume (He) :            all charged particles are killed inside 
-# CheckVolume (Air) :         is sensitive for scoring in front of thephantom
-# Phantom (H2O) :             is sensitive for radioactive dose calculation
-# Absorber in Phantom (H2O) : is sensitive for transverse dose calculation

World volume consists of Air.

\section ExampleGammaTherapy_s2 STEERING

Geometry and other parameters can be defined by G4 UI commands.

Following macro files are prepared for different targets used in the real
setup: be.in (thin Be target), be_w.in (thick BeW target), cu_w.in (thick
Cu W target).

Only Physics Lists from physics_list kernal library can be activated. 
Corresponding UI commands are following

\verbatim
/testem/phys/addPhysics       emstandard
/testem/phys/addPhysics       emstandard_opt3
/testem/phys/addPhysics       empenelope
/testem/phys/addPhysics       emlivermore
\endverbatim

For interactive mode G4 visualization options and variables should be
defined, then the example should be recompiled:

\verbatim
gmake visclean
gmake
\endverbatim

The vis.mac file can be used an example of visualization.

\section ExampleGammaTherapy_s3 HISTOGRAMS

Built in histograms are provided. Name of output root file can be
defined via UI command

\verbatim
/testem/histoName <myName>
\endverbatim
