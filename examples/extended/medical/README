        Geant4 extended examples - medical
        -----------------------------------

 Specific examples for medical physics applications are demonstarted 
 in this directory. 

DICOM
-----

This example serves first to convert a DICOM file to a simple ASCII 
file, where the Hounsfield numbers are converted to materials and 
densities so that it can be used by GEANT4. It serves also to create 
a GEANT4 geometry based on the DICOM file information using the 
G4PhantomParameterisation. 

DICOM2
------

This example demonstrates how to reuse the DICOM example library 
for another application.

dna
---
Set of examples using the Geant4-DNA physics processes and models.

electronScattering   
electronScattering2   
--------------------

These example demonstrate electron scattering benchmarks. 
ElectronScattering2 simulates the experiment with a minimum of user code, whereas the other
version of this example shows how to do more of the work directly as the user.

fanoCavity
------------

This example computes the dose deposited in an ionization chamber by a
monoenergetic photon beam.

fanoCavity2
------------

This example computes the dose deposited in an ionization chamber by an
extended (one dimensional) monoenergetic electron source.
This variante of the Fano cavity test make use of an reciprocity theorem.

GammaTherapy
------------

This example demonstrates a gamma therapy application.
