 Specific examples for medical physics applications are demonstarted 
 in this directory. 

\link ExampleDICOM DICOM \endlink

This example serves first to convert a DICOM file to a simple ASCII 
file, where the Hounsfield numbers are converted to materials and 
densities so that it can be used by GEANT4. It serves also to create 
a GEANT4 geometry based on the DICOM file information using the 
G4PhantomParameterisation. 

\link ExampleDICOM2 DICOM2 \endlink

This example demonstrates how to reuse the DICOM example library 
for another application.

\link Examples_dna dna \endlink

Set of examples using the Geant4-DNA physics processes and models.

\link ExampleelectronScattering electronScattering \endlink \n 
\link ExampleelectronScattering2 electronScattering2 \endlink  

These example demonstrate electron scattering benchmarks. 
ElectronScattering2 simulates the experiment with a minimum of user code, whereas the other
version of this example shows how to do more of the work directly as the user.

\link ExamplefanoCavity fanoCavity \endlink

This example computes the dose deposited in an ionization chamber by a
monoenergetic photon beam.

\link ExamplefanoCavity2 fanoCavity2 \endlink

This example computes the dose deposited in an ionization chamber by an
extended (one dimensional) monoenergetic electron source.
This variante of the Fano cavity test make use of an reciprocity theorem.

\link ExampleGammaTherapy GammaTherapy \endlink

This example demonstrates a gamma therapy application.
