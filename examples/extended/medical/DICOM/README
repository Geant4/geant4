--->1) Introduction

This example serves first to convert a DICOM file to a simple ASCII file, where the Hounsfield numbers are converted to materials and densities so that it can be used by GEANT4. It serves also to create a GEANT4 geometry based on the DICOM file information using the G4PhantomParameterisation. 

You can find the phantom reproduced in the image PhantomCT.jpg.
In the application the phantom is placed on a table.
 
---> 2) Installation:

 - A standard Geant4 example GNUmakefile is provided            
 - Compile it with 'make'/'gmake'
 
 - A standard Geant4 example CMakeLists.txt is provided
 - Configure via cmake with 'cmake -DGeant4_DIR=/path_to_geant4_install/lib/Geant4-x.x.x /path/to/DICOM/source' then make

---> 3) Run the example:

 - To run, the environment variable G4LEDATA needs to be set, pointing to the low energy data base, and the G4LEVELGAMMADATA pointing to the PhotonEvaporation data base

 - batch mode:
   - DICOM run.mac 

 - interactive mode:
   - DICOM
   the file vis.mac is read in order to visualise the phantom with OpenGL, DAWN or VRML
   
 - Environment variables:
   - DICOM_CHANGE_MATERIAL_DENSITY
     - set to the minimum density difference before making a separate material
     - e.g. if DenseBone is from > 1.496 to <= 1.654 and DICOM_CHANGE_MATERIAL_DENSITY=0.079
         then DenseBone would be separated into DenseBone > 1.496 to <= 1.575 and DenseBone > 1.575 to <= 1.654
   - DICOM_PARTIAL_PARAM
     - set to 1 to build the partial build instead of regular or nested construction (see section 9)
   - DICOM_NESTED_PARAM
     - set to 1 to build the nested construction (see section 9; overridden by DICOM_PARTIAL_PARAM)
   - DICOM_NTHREADS
     - To set the number of threads (when G4MULTITHREADED is defined via GEANT4_BUILD_MULTITHREADED=ON during Geant4 source build)
     - Needs to be set to the number of desired threads, e.g. DICOM_NTHREADS=8 (default is 4 threads)

--->4) Metadata:

 The file Data.dat has the following information
  - A line with the compression value (used only to create the .g4dcm and .g4dcmb, not to read it)
  - A line with the number of files 
  - A line for each file name (to these names it will be added the suffix .dcm to read the DICOM files in their original format, and the suffix .g4dcm to read the text files that contain the DICOM information where the Hounsfield numbers have been converted to material and densities)

In case you want to convert DICOM files to text files, it must have the following lines:
  - The number of materials you want to use
  - A line for each material describing its name and the upper bound of the density interval. The materials should be described in increasing order of density. The voxels with a density between 0. and the first upper bound will be assigned to the first material, those with a density between the first upper bound and the second upper bound will be assigned to the second material, etc.

--->5) Conversion of Hounsfield numbers to materials:

After reading the name of files from Data.dat, if a file .dcm is found, then it looks for the corresponding .g4dcm file and if not found creates it. 
Each file corresponds to a Z slice. The Z slices will be merged at runtime to form a unique patient volume; therefore the different slices have to be contiguous in Z.

The DICOM images pixel values represent CT (Hounsfield) numbers and they should be converted, first, to a given density and then to a material type.  The relation between CT number and density is more or less linear. 
The file CT2Density.dat contains the calibration curve to convert CT (Hounsfield) number to physical density
The assignment of material densities to materials is done following the information from the file Data.dat (see below). In this case we have used:

           #####################################################
           #     Density Range                   Material      #
           #---------------------------------------------------#
           #       mg/cm3                            -         #
           #---------------------------------------------------#

           #  [ 1.496 , 1.654 ]                 Dense Bone     #
           #####################################################

Data taken from the International Commission on Radiation Units and measurements (ICRU) report 46 was used to build the materials (lung, liver, breast, bones, ...)

--->6) Splitting materials in density intervals:

In the class DicomDetectorConstruction, it is defined a density interval

  G4double densityDiff = 0.1;

This means that the voxels of each material will be grouped in density intervals of 0.1 g/cm3 and a new material will be created for each group of voxels.

--->7) Voxel colouring:

The file Colormap.dat defines the colour that will be assigned to the voxels of each material.

--->8) DICOM file formats:

The DICOM files are converted to a simple text format. You may create your own file with the following format (see e.g. 14196616.g4dcm):

- A line with the number of materials
- A line for each material with its index and name (the same name of materials that you construct as G4Material's)
- A line with the number of voxels in X, Y and Z
- A line with the minimum and maximum extension in X (mm)
- A line with the minimum and maximum extension in Y (mm)
- A line with the minimum and maximum extension in Z (mm)
- A number of lines containing the nVoxelX*nVoxelY*nVoxelZ material indices (one per voxel)
- A number of lines containing the nVoxelX*nVoxelY*nVoxelZ material densities (one per voxel)

As commented before the DICOM files (.dcm) are assumed to describe one Z slice per file, and therefore the GEANT4 text files (.g4dcm) created from them have also one unique Z slice per file. Nevertheless if you create your own .g4dcm file you may include as many Z slices as desired. In any case you have to respect the rule that the Z slices must be contiguous.

The same information is also used to fill a file in binary format, that contains the same information as the text format. Its name ends in .g4dcmb, instead of .g4dcm .

--->9) Choosing different parameterisation/navigation options:

There are four possible ways in GEANT4 to treat the navigation in regular voxelised volumes:

- The 3D optimisation with G4SmartVoxel: a 3D grid is built, so that the location of voxels is fast, but it requires a lot of memory
- Using G4NestedParameterisation. The search is done hierarchically in X, Y and Z. It is fast and does not require big memory
- Using G4PhantomParameterisation/G4RegularNavigation: an special algorithm to navigate in regular voxelised geometries (see GEANT4 doc). This is the fastest way without any extra memory requirement (and it is the default in this example). It includes an option (default) to skip frontiers between voxels when they have the same material. When using this option at each step the energy is all deposited in the last voxel; for properly distribution of the dose (=energy/volume) the G4PSDoseDeposit_RegNav scorer can be used (see below).

Obsolete option:
- Use 1D optimisation in replica. It will be very slow because each time a track exits a voxel it has to loop to all other voxels in a 2D slide in order to locate which one it will enter.

You can select amongst the four options in the following way:

- By default the example will run with G4RegularNavigation

- To use the first option at RegularDicomDetectorConstruction.cc you must set

  patient_phys->SetRegularStructureId(0);

- To use the second option (Nested Parameterisation) you must set the enviromental variable DICOM_NESTED_PARAM to 1

- To use the final, obsolete 1D-option, apart from the change above at RegularDicomDetectorConstruction.cc you need to replace (i.e. use kUndefined)

  G4PVParameterised * patient_phys = new G4PVParameterised("Patient",voxel_logic,container_logic,
			kUndefined, nVoxelX*nVoxelY*nVoxelZ, param);
by 
  G4PVParameterised * patient_phys = new G4PVParameterised("Patient",voxel_logic,container_logic,
			kXAxis, nVoxelX*nVoxelY*nVoxelZ, param);

  Note also you must *not* set the enviromental variable DICOM_NESTED_PARAM.


--->10) Calculating dose in phantom voxels for regular navigation

As mentioned above the regular navigation has the option to keip voxel frontiers when two voxels share the same material, what can make the CPU time several times smaller. But this option makes that all energy deposited is computed in the last voxel, instead of distributing it along the voxels traversed. To properly calculate the dose in each voxel the G4PSDoseDeposit_RegNav scorer can be used.

It takes into account the fact that,  when the particle travels through the voxels it looses energy and therefore the energy lost per length (dEdx) is bigger and also the effect of the multiple scattering is bigger. 
The algorithm to make this correction is an iterative one, as the step length increase due multiple scattering (that converts the geometrical step length in what we will call the true step length) and the energy loss are correlated.
It works in the folloing way: first the total true step length is distributed among the voxels proportionally to their geometrical step length; with these values it is calculated one voxel after another the value of dEdx and then the value of the kinetic energy at the entrance of each voxel; with these values it is calculated the geometrical to true step corrections due to multiple scattering for each voxel; finally these new values are used to recalculate the energy lost in each voxel. It has been demonstrated for dose in a water phantom and in a real phantom that the two-step iteration described is enough to reproduce the dose calcualted when no skipping of voxel frontiers is done.

This scorer is implemented in this examples if the regular navigation option is 
chosen. It is triggered at the method RegularDicomDetectorConstruction::ConstructPhantom() by the call

SetScorer(voxel_logic);

--->11) Output
dicom.out is produced running the macro file run.mac. It has 2 columns: the first is the number of 
voxel (ordered in x,y,z) and the second the dose there deposited (in Gy)
It is produced, as an example, with a compression value of 32


--->12) Partial phantom 
It is possible to create a partial phantom, that is the intersection of a phantom with a volume. You may define the volume with the command 

/dicom/intersectWithUserVolume 0. 0. 0. 45.*deg 0. 0. TUBE 0. 150. 100.

where the first three arguments are its position, its second three arguments are the rotation around the global X, Y and Z axis and the rest of the parameters are the same that you use to build a solid using the ASCII geometry format

Alternatively you can intersect the phantom with an existing Geant4 volume with the command

/dicom/intersectWithG4Volume VOLUME_NAME

The job will create an ASCII file names "phantom.g4pdcm" containing the partial phantom. To read this file all what is needed is to set the enviromental variable DICOM_PARTIAL_PARAM to 1
