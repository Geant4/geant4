                            Hadr06
                            ------

   Survey energy deposition and particle's flux from an hadronic cascade.
   Use PhysicsConstructor objects rather than predefined G4 PhysicsLists.   

	
 1- MATERIALS AND GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
   The geometry is a single sphere (absorber) of an homogenous material.
    
   Two parameters define the geometry :
	- the radius of the sphere	   
 	- the material of the sphere
 	
   The default geometry (R=30 cm of water) is built in 
   DetectorConstruction, but the above parameters can be changed interactively 
   via commands defined in DetectorMessenger.
   
   The absorber is surrounded by a World volume (vacuum)
   
   A function, and its associated UI command, allows to build a material
   directly from a single isotope.
   
   To be identified by the ThermalScattering module, the elements composing a
   material must have a specific name (see G4ParticleHPThermalScatteringNames.cc)
   Examples of such materials are build in DetectorConstruction.
 	
 2- PHYSICS LIST
   
  "Full" set of physics processes are registered, but via PhysicsConstructor
  objects rather than complete pre-defined G4 physics lists. This alternative 
  way gives more freedom to register physics.
  
  PhysicsConstructors are either predefined G4 PhysicsConstructors or 'local'. 
  They include : HadronElastic (including neutronHP), HadronInelastic,
  IonsInelastic, GammaNuclear physics, RadioactiveDecay and electomagnetic.
  (see geant4/source/physics_lists/constructors)
    
  Several hadronic physics options are controlled by environment variables.
  To trigger them, an envHadronic.csh has been added in this example.
  One must select the options wished, and do
        source envHadronic.csh  (or sh) 
 	 
 3- AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
   The primary kinematic is a single particle randomly shooted at the 
   centre of the sphere. The type of the particle and its energy are set in 
   PrimaryGeneratorAction (neutron 14 MeV), and can be changed via the G4 
   build-in commands of ParticleGun class (see the macros provided with 
   this example).
 	
 4- PHYSICS

   The program computes and plots energy deposited in the interaction volume
   (absorber) and the flux of particles leaving this volume.
   Processes invoked and particles generated during hadronic cascade are listed.

 5- HISTOGRAMS
         
   The test contains 13 built-in 1D histograms, which are managed by
   G4AnalysisManager and its Messenger. The histos can be individually 
   activated with the command :
   /analysis/h1/set id nbBins  valMin valMax unit 
   where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, etc..)
   (see the macros xxxx.mac).
   
            1     "total energy deposit"
            2     "Edep (MeV/mm) profile along radius"		  
            3     "total kinetic energy flow"
            4     "gamma flux (dN/dE) at exit"
            5     "e+- flux (dN/dE) at exit"
            6     "neutrons flux (dN/dE) at exit"
            7     "protons flux (dN/dE) at exit"
            8     "deuterons flux (dN/dE) at exit"
            9     "alphas flux (dN/dE) at exit"
            10    "all others ions flux (dN/dE) at exit"
            11    "all others baryons flux (dN/dE) at exit"
            12    "all others mesons flux (dN/dE) at exit"
            13    "all others leptons flux (dN/dE) at exit" 
      
   The histograms are managed by the HistoManager class and its Messenger. 
   The histos can be individually activated with the command :
   /analysis/h1/set id nbBins  valMin valMax unit 
   where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, deg or mrad, etc..)
   
   One can control the name of the histograms file with the command:
   /analysis/setFileName  name  (default Hadr06)
   
   It is possible to choose the format of the histogram file : root (default),
   xml, csv, by using namespace in HistoManager.hh
       
   It is also possible to print selected histograms on an ascii file:
   /analysis/h1/setAscii id
   All selected histos will be written on a file name.ascii (default Hadr04) 
 	 				
 6- VISUALIZATION
 
   The Visualization Manager is set in the main().
   The initialisation of the drawing is done via the commands
   /vis/... in the macro vis.mac. To get visualisation:
   > /control/execute vis.mac
 	
   The tracks are drawn at the end of event, and erased at the end of run.   
   gamma green   
   neutron yellow
   negative particles (e-, ...) red
   positive particles (e+, ions, ...) blue
 	
 7- HOW TO START ?
 
   Execute Hadr06 in 'batch' mode from macro files :
 	% Hadr06   run1.mac
 		
   Execute Hadr06 in 'interactive mode' with visualization :
 	% Hadr06
	Idle> control/execute vis.mac
 	....
 	Idle> type your commands
 	....
 	Idle> exit
