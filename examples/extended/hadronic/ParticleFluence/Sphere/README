In this example, the particle fluence is evaluated for a very simple
set-up, consisting of one target solid sphere, at the center of which
a particle is shot (by default along the z-axis).

The particle fluence is computed in two places: "forward" and "backward",
defined as the positions immediately after and before, respectively, of
the target with respect to the direction of the primary particle.

The particle fluence is estimated by summing the track length in a
"scoring volume" - i.e. a thin hemisphere shell filled up with G4_Galactic
(very low density gas) material, immediately outside the target sphere -
and then dividing for the cubic volume of such scoring volume.

Complementary information on average multiplicity, average kinetic energy,
and average total energy flow (i.e. sum of kinetic energies) for the
particles produced in the target are also computed.

The particle fluence is evaluated for the following 11 particle types:
-  all
-  electron + positron 
-  gamma
-  muon- + muon+
-  neutrino (any flavour and including anti-neutrino)
-  charged pions
-  neutron + anti_neutron
-  proton + anti_proton
-  ion (and anti-ions)
-  otherMeson (e.g. kaons, etc.)
-  otherBaryon (e.g. hyperons, etc.)

The particle fluence is evaluated for the following 3 kinematical ranges:
-  any kinetic energy
-  kinetic energy < 20 MeV
-  kinetic energy > 20 MeV

Look for the string "***LOOKHERE***" for those parameters/options that
are either hardwired in the code (i.e. not available via UI command),
or default values of UI commands.

This example uses the physics list factory, therefore you can specify
the reference physics list you want to use via the PHYSLIST
environmental variable (by default, if you don't set it, the FTFP_BERT
physics list is used).

To build this example:

  mkdir Build; cd Build
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
        -DGeant4_DIR=/path-to-geant4-libraries ../.
  make

To run it:

  ./Sphere all_together.g4

which shoots 50 GeV pion- on different target materials, 100 events
in each run, and print out some information on the particle fluence
at the end of each run.
Other macros exist for specific materials.
