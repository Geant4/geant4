# Example ParticleFluence History

See `CONTRIBUTING.rst` for details of **required** info/format for each entry,
which **must** added in reverse chronological order (newest at the top). It must **not**
be used as a substitute for writing good git commit messages!

## 2023-10-26 Alberto Ribon (exhadrParticleFluenceCalo-V11-01-01)
- Renamed macro files from *.g4 to *.in, and documented them in README

## 2023-05-08 Alberto Ribon (exhadrParticleFluenceCalo-V11-01-00)
- Run, TrackingAction : replaced G4int with G4long for keeping the information
  on the multiplicity of particle production.
  (This avoids rare cases of negative multiplicities due to integer overflow,
   seen for runs with at least 4000 events, in particular with heavy materials,
   such as Tungsten and Lead.)

## 2022-09-07 Alberto Ribon (exhadrParticleFluenceCalo-V11-00-02)
- Added complementary information on particle production (multiplicity,
  kinetic energy, and total energy flow) in the calorimeter.

## 2022-08-26 Alberto Ribon (exhadrParticleFluenceCalo-V11-00-01)
- SteppingAction : introduced protection on the value of the array index.

## 2021-06-10 Alberto Ribon (exhadrParticleFluenceCalo-V11-00-00)
- Created the Calo variant of the ParticleFluence example.
