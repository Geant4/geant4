In this example, the particle fluence is evaluated for simplified,
cylindrical hadronic calorimeters with axis along the z-direction,
and a beam particle shot before the calorimeter along its axis.

The particle fluence is computed in three places: "upstream", "downstream"
and "side", defined as the positions immediately after, before and aside,
respectively, of the calorimeter with respect to the direction of the
primary particle.

The particle fluence is estimated by summing the track length in a
"scoring volume" - i.e. a thin cylinder (for "upstream" and "downstream"
cases) or a thin hemisphere shell (for the "side" case) filled up with
G4_Galactic (very low density gas) material, immediately outside the
calorimeter - and then dividing for the cubic volume of such scoring volume.

Complementary information on average multiplicity, average kinetic energy,
and average total energy flow (i.e. sum of kinetic energies) for the
particles produced in the calorimeter are also computed.

The particle fluence is evaluated for the following 11 particle types:
-  all
-  electron + positron 
-  gamma
-  muon- + muon+
-  neutrino (any flavour and including anti-neutrino)
-  charged pions
-  neutron + anti_neutron
-  proton + anti_proton
-  ion (and anti-ions)
-  otherMeson (e.g. kaons, etc.)
-  otherBaryon (e.g. hyperons, etc.)

The particle fluence is evaluated for the following 3 kinematical ranges:
-  any kinetic energy
-  kinetic energy < 20 MeV
-  kinetic energy > 20 MeV

Look for the string "***LOOKHERE***" for those parameters/options that
are either hardwired in the code (i.e. not available via UI command),
or default values of UI commands.

This example uses the physics list factory, therefore you can specify
the reference physics list you want to use via the PHYSLIST
environmental variable (by default, if you don't set it, the FTFP_BERT
physics list is used).

To build this example:

  mkdir Build; cd Build
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
        -DGeant4_DIR=/path-to-geant4-libraries ../.
  make

To run it:

  ./Calo atlasHec.g4

which shoots 50 GeV pion- on a simplified ATLAS HEC hadronic calorimeter,
in one run of 100 events, and print out some information on the particle
fluence at the end of the run.
Other macros exist for other types of simplified hadronic calorimeters.
