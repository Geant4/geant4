 Examples in this directory demonstrate specific set-ups in
 which to evaluate particle fluence.

\link ExampleSphere Sphere \endlink
This set-up consists of a full solid target sphere - whose radius and
material can be set via UI commands.
The primary particle is shot from the center of the target sphere
(along the z-axis direction by default).
As scoring volume, we use a thin spherical shell outside the target sphere.
The particle fluences are evaluated in the forward and backward hemispheres
(with respect to the primary particle direction).

\link ExampleConcentricSpheres ConcentricSpheres \endlink
Similar to the Sphere one, but with two larger solid target spherical shells
outside the first one, separated by some space filled up by G4_Galactic.
The dimensions of these three targets - which are meant as a simplified
proxy for, respectively, a Tracker (inner sphere), EM (electromagnetic)
calorimeter (middle spherical shell), and HAD (hadronic) calorimeter
(external spherical shell) - and their materials can be set via UI commands.
As scoring volumes, we use three thin spherical shells immediately outside
the inner target sphere and the two target spherical shells.
The particle fluences are evaluated in the forward and backward hemispheres
(with respect to the primary particle direction).

\link ExampleLayer Layer \endlink
This set-up consists of a cylinder, with axis along the z-direction, whose
radius, length (i.e. thickness) and material can be set via UI commands.
The primary particle is shot by default along the z-axis, from behind
the target.
As scoring volumes, we use three thin cylindrical layers, filled up by
G4_Galactic, and placed downstream, upstream, and aside of the target
cylinder.

\link ExampleLayer Calo \endlink
Similar to the Layer one, the target consists of a simplified cylindrical
hadronic calorimeter, whose properties - size, number of layers, sampling
fraction, active and absorber materials - can be set via UI commands.
Similarly to the Layer case, the the particle fluences are evaluated in the
downstream, upstream and aside positions.
