# Example FlukaCern History

See `CONTRIBUTING.rst` for details of **required** info/format for each entry,
which **must** added in reverse chronological order (newest at the top). It must **not**
be used as a substitute for writing good git commit messages!

## 2025-03-21 Gabrielle Hugo (FlukaCern-V11-03-02)
- Ensure compatibility with FLUKA v4-5.0: make the link time resolution of COMMON blocks 
  (declared as external structs in the C++ source) compatible with the new FLUKA version.

## 2024-11-15 Gabrielle Hugo (FlukaCern-V11-02-01)
- Should NOT propagate the track/projectile's direction (dir) from Geant4 to the FLUKA event generator, 
  as the transformation (from dir to the lab) of the final state is already performed in Geant4. 
  The FLUKA event generator shall hence work in Geant4 local frame, 
  while Geant4 is in charge of transforming the final state back to the lab.

## 2024-10-31 Gabrielle Hugo (FlukaCern-V11-02-00)
- Fix headers re-rodering by clang-format (cannot be placed in alphabetical order due to global constants).

## 2023-10-23 Ben Morgan (FlukaCern-V11-01-00)
- Rename FlukaInterface's `Makefile` to `GNUmakefile` to avoid file being ignored in export.
