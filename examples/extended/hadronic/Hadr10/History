# Example Hadr10 History

See `CONTRIBUTING.rst` for details of **required** info/format for each entry,
which **must** added in reverse chronological order (newest at the top).
It must **not** be used as a substitute for writing good git commit messages!

- DetectorMessenger: define "/mydet/update" command also for PreInit state
  and call "/run/initialize" after geometry update in hadr10.in script, to
  avoid run-time warning messages in output:
  "Start re-initialization because Geometry has been modified since last Run."
  repeated many times in MT mode.

- SteppingAction: protect the argument of acos to be within -1 and +1
  (in system testing we have seen recently cases of crashes caused by the
   argument of acos being outside that interval).
