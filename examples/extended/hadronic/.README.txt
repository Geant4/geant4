 Examples in this directory demonstrate specific hadronic physics simulation 
 with histogramming.

\link ExampleHadr00 Hadr00 \endlink

This example demonstrates a usage of G4PhysListFactory to build 
Physics List and G4HadronicProcessStore to access cross sections.

\link ExampleHadr01 Hadr01 \endlink

This example application is based on the application IION developed for
simulation of proton or ion beam interaction with a water target. Different 
aspects of beam target interaction are demonstrating in the example including 
longitudinal profile of energy deposition, spectra of secondary  particles,
spectra of particles leaving the target. 

\link ExampleHadr02 Hadr02 \endlink

This example application is providing simulation of ion beam interaction with different 
targets. Hadronic aspects of beam target interaction are demonstrated in the example 
including longitudinal profile of energy deposition, spectra of secondary  particles,
isotope production spectra. 

\link ExampleHadr03 Hadr03 \endlink

This example demonstrates how to compute total cross section from the direct evaluation of the 
mean free path ( see below, item Physics), how to identify nuclear reactions, how to plot 
energy spectrum of secondary particles.	

\link ExampleHadr04 Hadr04 \endlink

This example is focused on neutronHP physics, especially neutron transport,
including thermal scattering.

\link ExampleHadr06 Hadr06 \endlink

This example demonstrates survey of energy deposition and particle's flux from 
a hadronic cascade.

\link ExampleHadr07 Hadr07 \endlink

Survey energy deposition and particle's flux from an hadronic cascade.
Use PhysicsConstructor objects rather than predefined G4 PhysicsLists.
Show how to plot a depth dose profile in a rectangular box.

\link ExampleFissionFragment FissionFragment \endlink

This example demonstrates the Fission Fragment model as used within the
neutron_hp model. It will demostrate the capability for fission product
containmentby the cladding in a water moderated sub-critical assembly. It could
also be further extended to calculate the effective multiplication factor of
the subcritical assembly for various loading schemes.

\link ExampleNeutronSource NeutronSource \endlink

NeutronSource is an example of neutrons production. It illustrates the cooperative work
of nuclear reactions and radioactive decay processes.
It survey energy deposition and particle's flux.
It uses PhysicsConstructor objects.

The example Hadr05, which demonstrated the usage of G4GenericPhysicsList to build 
the concrete physics list at the run time, has been repleced in Geant4 10.4  by 
extended/physicslists/genericPL the generic physics list was demonstrated in the 
extended/hadronic/Hadr05 example.
