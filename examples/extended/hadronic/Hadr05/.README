This example demonstrates the usage of G4GenericPhysicsList to build 
the concrete physics list at the run time. The code is a copy of
example Hadr00 with the only exception of the main file, where the
physics list is handled using the G4GenericPhysicsList
mechanism. Please refer to Hadr00 documentation for any other
functionality. 

The G4GenericPhysicsList class allows to build the physics list at the run
time in two possible ways, either by processing a macro file
containing the 'physics list' or by passing a vector of 'physics
constructors' names to the constructor of the class.

To run the example you can call

\verbatim
Hadr05 hadr05.in FTFP_BERT.mac
\endverbatim

where FTFP_BERT.mac is the macro file containing the 'physics list'. 

If you run this example by calling

\verbatim
Hadr05 hadr05.in
\endverbatim

the physics list will be constructed by using a vector of the names of
the different physics constructor defined in the Hard05.cc file.
