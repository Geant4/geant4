# Example Hadr08 History

See `CONTRIBUTING.rst` for details of **required** info/format for each entry,
which **must** added in reverse chronological order (newest at the top). It must **not**
be used as a substitute for writing good git commit messages!


## 2022-09-07 Vladimir Ivanchenko (exhadr08-V11-00-02)
- BiasingOperation - used the Bertini cascade instead of pre-compound 
    model, the last was not applicable for pion interactions. The Bertini
    cascade is applied from 0 to 41 MeV, INCLXX from 40 MeV to 12 GeV

## 2022-09-05 Vladimir Ivanchenko (exhadr08-V11-00-01)
- BiasingOperation - transition from pre-compound model to INCL++
    is changed from 1-2 MeV to 20-21 MeV in order to fix infinite
    loops happens in nightly tests
- Hadr08.cc - run initialisation is moved to macro files
