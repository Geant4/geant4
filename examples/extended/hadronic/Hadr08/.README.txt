This is an example of how to use "generic biasing" to get the following
functionality which is currently not available directly in the Geant4
hadronic framework.

\section Hadr08_s1 PHYSICS LIST

We want to use the physics list FTFP_BERT everywhere in our detector,
except that in one (or more) logical volume(s) we want to use a 
different combination of hadronic models, e.g. FTFP + INCLXX 
(instead of the default FTFP + BERT), for the final-state generation.

Notice that we use the powerful "generic biasing" machinery available
in Geant4, but the actual weights of all tracks remain to the usual
value (1.0) as in the normal (unbiased) case.

\section Hadr08_s2 MATERIALS AND GEOMETRY DEFINITION

In this example, the detector is very simple: 
-  a homogeneous block of silicon, as a proxy of a tracker sub-detector;
-  followed by a crystal, as a proxy of an electromagnetic calorimeter;
-  followed by a homogeneous block of iron, as a proxy of a hadron
   calorimeter.
We assume that the block of silicon is where we want to replace FTFP+BERT
with FTFP+INCLXX for the final-state modeling of proton, neutron, pion-
and pion+-inelastic interactions (of any energy).
This silicon layer is made artificially thick (20 cm) in order to have
more hadron inelastic interactions for testing.

This example has been tested only for G4 10.5.p01 and 10.6, but it should
work also for previous recent releases (i.e. 10.4 and 10.3).
The example works in both sequential and multi-threaded modes, and the
CPU overhead due to "generic biasing" for this application seems to be
very small (at the per-cent level).

\section Hadr08_s3 HOW TO START ?

To build it:
\verbatim
  mkdir Build; cd Build
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
        -DGeant4_DIR=/path-to-geant4-libraries ../.
  make
\endverbatim

To run it:
\verbatim
  ./Hadr08 hadr08.in  
\endverbatim
which shoot 100 pion+ of 5 GeV kinetic energy.
