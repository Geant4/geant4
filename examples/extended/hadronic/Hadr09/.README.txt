/*! \page ExampleHadr09 Example Hadr09

This example shows how to use Geant4 as a generator for simulating
inelastic hadron-nuclear interactions.

The class HadronicGenerator is the "generator".
The main hadronic models (FTFP, QGSP, BERT, BIC, IonBIC, INCL)
and some combinations of two of them - in a transition energy region,
similarly to what happens in physics lists - are available.
See include/HadronicGenerator.hh for more detailed information.

The main, Hadr09.cc, shows an example of how to use it.
It samples randomly the projectile hadron, its energy, its direction
and the target material, and then it calls the generator.
Some information regarding the secondaries which are produced can be
printed out.
See the comments in Hadr09.cc for more information and how eventually
to change some of its configurations.
Notice that Hadr09.cc does nothing really useful: users should consider
to use eventually only the class HadronicGenerator.

Notice that the Geant4 run-manager is not used.

\section Hadr09_s1 HOW TO START ?

To build it:
\verbatim
  mkdir Build; cd Build
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
        -DGeant4_DIR=/path-to-geant4-libraries ../.
  make
\endverbatim

To run it:
\verbatim
  ./Hadr09
\endverbatim

which simulates 1000 hadron-nucleus collisions, randomnly selected, and
prints out some information about the secondaries produced in these
interactions. It takes only a few seconds to run.

Note: this example has been included in Geant4 10.7, but it should work
      also for early versions of Geant4, in particular 10.6, 10.5 and 10.4.
