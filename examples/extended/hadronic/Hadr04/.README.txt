/*! \page ExampleHadr04 Example Hadr04

   This example is focused on neutronHP physics, especially neutron transport,
   including thermal scattering.
   See A.R. Garcia, E. Mendoza, D. Cano-Ott presentation at G4 Hadronic group
   meeting (04/2013) and note on G4NeutronHP package
   	
\section Hadr04_s1 MATERIALS AND GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
   It is a single box representing a 'quasi infinite' homogeneous medium.
   Two parameters define the geometry :
 	- the material of the box,
	- the (full) size of the box.
 	
   The default geometry (1 m3 of pressurized water) is built in 
   DetectorConstruction, but the above parameters can be changed interactively 
   via commands defined in DetectorMessenger.
   
   A function, and its associated UI command, allows to build a material
   directly from a single isotope.
   
   To be identified by the ThermalScattering module, the elements composing a
   material must have a specific name (see G4NeutronHPThermalScatteringNames.cc)
   Examples of such materials are build in DetectorConstruction.
 	
\section Hadr04_s2 PHYSICS LIST
   
   Only processes of neutronHP package are registered : neutronElastic 
   (including thermalScattering), neutronInelastic, nCapture; nFission.
   See class NeutronHPphysics. No other hadronic nor electromagnetic processes.
   
   A command allows to select or not ThermalScattering model.
 
   Several hadronic physics options are controlled by environment variables.
   To trigger them, an envHadronic.csh has been added in this example.
   One must select the options wished, and do
\verbatim   
        source envHadronic.csh  (or sh)
\endverbatim	 
   
   NB. class NeutronHPphysics can be reused with other physicsConstructors,
   as neutron processes are deleted before to be re-created.
   	 	 
\section Hadr04_s3 AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
   The primary kinematic is a single particle randomly shooted at the 
   centre of the box. The type of the particle and its energy are set in 
   PrimaryGeneratorAction (neutron 2 MeV), and can be changed via the G4 
   build-in commands of ParticleGun class (see the macros provided with 
   this example).
 	
\section Hadr04_s4 PHYSICS

   All secondaries are killed in StackingAction. Therefore an event consists of
   the transport of the primary neutron. Then one survey the thermal and non
   thermal part of this parcours.


\section Hadr04_s5 HISTOGRAMS
         
   The test contains 7 built-in 1D histograms, which are managed by
   G4AnalysisManager and its Messenger. The histos can be individually 
   activated with the command :
   /analysis/h1/set id nbBins  valMin valMax unit 
   where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, etc..)
   (see the macros xxxx.mac).
   
   - 1   "incident neutron: nb of collisions above 1 eV"
   - 2   "incident neutron: total track length above 1 eV"
   - 3   "incident neutron: time of flight above 1 eV"
   - 4   "incident neutron: nb of collisions below 1 eV"
   - 5   "incident neutron: total track length below 1*eV"
   - 6   "incident neutron: time of flight below 1 eV"
   - 7   "incident neutron: energy distribution below 1*eV"   
      
   The histograms are managed by the HistoManager class and its Messenger. 
   The histos can be individually activated with the command :
\verbatim
/analysis/h1/set id nbBins  valMin valMax unit 
\endverbatim   
   where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, deg or mrad, etc..)
   
   One can control the name of the histograms file with the command:
\verbatim
/analysis/setFileName  name  (default Hadr04)
\endverbatim   
   It is possible to choose the format of the histogram file : root (default),
   xml, csv, by using namespace in HistoManager.hh
       
   It is also possible to print selected histograms on an ascii file:
\verbatim
/analysis/h1/setAscii id
\endverbatim   
   All selected histos will be written on a file name.ascii (default Hadr04) 
 	 				
\section Hadr04_s6 VISUALIZATION
 
   The Visualization Manager is set in the main().
   The initialisation of the drawing is done via the commands
   /vis/... in the macro vis.mac. To get visualisation:
\verbatim
> /control/execute vis.mac
\endverbatim
 	
   The detector has a default view which is a longitudinal view of the box.
   The tracks are drawn at the end of event, and erased at the end of run.
	
\section Hadr04_s7 HOW TO START ?
 
   Execute Hadr04 in 'batch' mode from macro files :
\verbatim   
% Hadr04   run01.mac
\endverbatim
 		
   Execute Hadr04 in 'interactive mode' with visualization :
\verbatim   
% Hadr04
Idle> control/execute vis.mac
 ....
 Idle> type your commands
 ....
 Idle> exit
\endverbatim
