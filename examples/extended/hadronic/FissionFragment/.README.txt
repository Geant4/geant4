 This example demonstrates an application of the fission fragment model in the
 NeutronHP model. This example is capable of using both models, but is designed
 around the Wendt Fission Model. A warning will be shown if the environment
 variable that enables the Wendt fission model is not set.

\section FissionFragment_s1                                            EXECUTION
   
\subsection FissionFragment_sub1_s1                                ENVIRONMENT
  - <CODE> G4NEUTRONHP_PRODUCE_FISSION_FRAGMENTS </CODE>
    - Required
    - The example requires this enviroment variable to be set. An error will be
      displayed and the example will terminate if this environment variable is
      not set.
 
  - <CODE> G4NEUTRON_HP_USE_WENDT_FISSION_MODEL </CODE>
    - Optional
    - This environment variable enables the Wendt fission model contained within
      the NeutronHP model for simulating fission events. The default model will
      be used otherwise. A warning will be displayed if this environment
      variable is not set.
         
\subsection FissionFragment_sub2_s1                     COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
     The example can be run without any input arguments. However, a few options
     are available:
\verbatim
  -i ARG      : run in batch mode from script file ARG
  -o ARG      : write output to file ARG
                (defaults to FF_Neutron_HP.out)
  -n ARG      : multithreading with ARG number of threads
                (only works if Geant4 was compiled with multithreading enabled)
\endverbatim
     No output is currently generated, although the argument is provided. It is
     anticipated that future versions will provide some form of output
     summarizing the results of the simulation.
     
\subsection FissionFragment_sub3_s1                                INTERACTIVE
     No specialized UI commands are currently provided.
     
     To run the simulation, use the standard UI command:
\verbatim
  /run/beamOn
\endverbatim
     
 
\section FissionFragment_s2                                             GEOMETRY
	
   The geometry is constructed in the FFDetectorConstruction class. The setup is
   based on a subcritical assembly design.
   
\subsection FissionFragment_sub1_s2                                  MATERIALS
     This example requires a number of materials. They are loaded or constructed
     in the "DefineMaterials" function. A few of the materials are obtained from
     the NIST database. These materials are:
      - Air
      - Aluminum
      - Graphite
      - Polyethylene
      - Stainless steel
      - Water
      
     For more information, visit: <A HREF="http://bit.ly/1rEHjhW"> Geant4 User's
     Guide for Application Developers, Appendix: Geant4 Materials Database </A>
      
     Not all of the necessary materials were available from the NIST database,
     and were constructed manually from the estimated isotopics. These materials
     are:
      - 20% U235 enriched uranium
      - 93% B10 enriched BF3
   
\subsection FissionFragment_sub2_s2                                    VOLUMES
     The world is composed of air instead of a vacuum to provide room return.
     
     The subcritical assembly is a water-filled aluminum tank.
     
     The fuel plates are composed of aluminum-clad uranium meat, and are
     completely submersed in the water of the subcritical assembly.
     
     An AmBe neutron source is placed in the exact center of the fuel plate
     loading configuration. The material is currently modeled as steel until
     more exact specifics of the AmBe isotopics can be obtained.
     
     The subcritical assembly rests on top of a graphite pile for moderation and
     shielding.
     

\section FissionFragment_s3                                         PHYSICS LIST
 
   The particle's type and the physic processes which will be available
   in this example are set in the QGSP_BIC_HP physics list.
   
  
\section FissionFragment_s4                                    PRIMARY GENERATOR
  
   The primary generator is defined in the FFPrimaryGeneratorAction class.
   The default particle is a 4.5 MeV neutron originating from the
   "NeutronSource" volume. The particles initial direction is isotropically
   sampled.
   
 
\section FissionFragment_s5                                    DETECTOR RESPONSE

   The scoring method is yet to be implemented, although the BF3 detector is
   already included in the detector construction.
   
 
\section FissionFragment_s6                                        VISUALISATION
   An example "vis.mac" will be included in a future release. For now, please
   refer to other examples for a few suggestions.
