/*! \page Examples_field Category "field"

 Examples in this directory demonstrate specific simulation setups 
 in magnetic field.
 
\link Examplefield01 field01 \endlink

Example enabling investigation of tracking in a magnetic field.

\link Examplefield02 field02 \endlink

Test for investigation of tracking in electric field and field dependent 
electromagnetic processes.

\link Examplefield03 field03 \endlink

Example of tracking in magnetic field where field associated
to selected logical volumes varies.

\link Examplefield04 field04 \endlink

This example shows how to define/use OVERLAPPING field elements 
in Geant4. Fields might be either magnetic, electric or both.

\link Examplefield05 field05 \endlink

This example demonstrates so-called "spin-frozen" condition.

\link Examplefield06 field06 \endlink

This example exercises the capability of tracking massive
particles in a gravity field.
     
\link ExampleBlineTracer  BlineTracer \endlink

The BlineTracer module allows to trace and visualise magnetic field 
lines in a Geant4 application where particle are tracked through the
magnetic field (in future, these functionalities may be integrated in
the Geant4 kernel).
