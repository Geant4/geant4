        Geant4 extended examples - field
        ----------------------------------

 Examples in this directory demonstrate specific simulation setups 
 in magnetic field.
 
field01
--------
Example enabling investigation of tracking in a magnetic field.

field02
--------
Test for investigation of tracking in electric field and field dependent 
electromagnetic processes.

field03
--------
Example of tracking in magnetic field where field associated
to selected logical volumes varies.

field04
--------
This example shows how to define/use OVERLAPPING field elements 
in Geant4. Fields might be either magnetic, electric or both.

field05
--------
This example demonstrates so-called "spin-frozen" condition.

field06
--------
This example exercises the new (in 9.5) capability of tracking massive
particles in a gravity field.
     
BlineTracer 
------------
The BlineTracer module allows to trace and visualise magnetic field 
lines in a Geant4 application where particle are tracked through the
magnetic field (in future, these functionalities may be integrated in
the Geant4 kernel).
