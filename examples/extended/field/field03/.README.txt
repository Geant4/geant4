 Example of tracking in magnetic field where field associated
 to selected logical volumes varies.

	
\section field03_s1 GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
 The "absorber" is a solid made of a given material.                
 
 Three parameters define the absorber :
 - the material of the absorber,
	- the thickness of an absorber,
 - the transverse size of the absorber (the input face is a square). 
    
 The volume "World" contains the "absorber". 
 In this test the parameters of the "World" can be changed , too.

 In addition a transverse uniform magnetic field can be applied.
 
 The default geometry is constructed in F03DetectorConstruction class,
 but all the parameters can be changed via
 the commands defined in the F03DetectorMessenger class.
 
\section field03_s2 AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
 The primary kinematic consists of a single particle which hits the
 absorber perpendicular to the input face. The type of the particle
 and its energy are set in the F03PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can
 be changed via the G4 build-in commands of G4ParticleGun class (see
 the macros provided with this example).
 
 A RUN is a set of events.
 
\section field03_s3 DETECTOR RESPONSE

 
 A HIT is a record, event per event , of all the 
 informations needed to simulate and analyse the detector response.
 
 In this example a F03CalorHit is defined as a set of 2 informations:
 - the total energy deposit in the absorber,
 - the total tracklength of all charged particles in the absorber,  
 
 Therefore  the absorber is declared
 'sensitive detector' (SD), see F03CalorimeterSD, which means they can contribute to the hit.

 
\subsection field01_s4 PHYSICS LIST
 
 The particle's type and the physic processes which will be available
 in this example are set in the FTFP_BERT physics list. This physics list 
 requires data files for electromagnetic and hadronic processes.
 See more on installation of the datasets in Geant4 Installation Guide,
