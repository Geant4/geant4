- In F03FieldSetup: 
  - Do not declare fLocalFieldManager thread-local
    as the F03FieldSetup is already thread-local object

  tagged in examples/field

October 17, 2012 - I.Hrivnacova - fieldex03-V09-05-00
-----------------------------
- Applied coding guidelines, code clean-up

August 16th, 2010 H.Kurashige - fieldex03-V09-03-04

Apr 27th, 2007 Peter Gumplinger (fieldex03-V08-02-00)
- Fixed bug in F03FieldSetup:
  fFieldManager = fLocalFieldManager = GetGlobalFieldManager();
  fFieldManager->SetDetectorField(fMagneticField );
  fLocalFieldManager->SetDetectorField(fLocalMagneticField );
  The above is a pointer copy and the two G4FieldManager point
  to the same object; i.e. fLocalMagneticField replaces fMagneticField
  in the GlobalFieldManager. This is not at all the intended functionalty
  supposed to be exhibited by this example!
