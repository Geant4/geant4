\page Examples_field Category "field"

 Examples in this directory demonstrate specific simulation setups
 in magnetic field.

\ref Examplefield01

Example enabling investigation of tracking in a magnetic field.

\ref Examplefield02

Test for investigation of tracking in electric field and field dependent
electromagnetic processes.

\ref Examplefield03

Example of tracking in magnetic field where field associated
to selected logical volumes varies.

\ref Examplefield04

This example shows how to define/use OVERLAPPING field elements
in Geant4. Fields might be either magnetic, electric or both.

\ref Examplefield05

This example demonstrates so-called "spin-frozen" condition.

\ref Examplefield06

This example exercises the capability of tracking massive
particles in a gravity field.

\ref ExampleBlineTracer

The BlineTracer module allows to trace and visualise magnetic field
lines in a Geant4 application where particle are tracked through the
magnetic field (in future, these functionalities may be integrated in
the Geant4 kernel).
