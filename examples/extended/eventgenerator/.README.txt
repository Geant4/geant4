 Examples in this directory demonstrate various ways of primary event
 generation.

\link ExampleparticleGun particleGun \endlink

This example demonstrates 4 ways of the usage of G4ParticleGun shooting
primary particles in different cases.

\link Exampleexgps exgps \endlink

This example demonstrates the usage of G4GeneralParticleSource for generating 
primary incident particle according to user defined distributions.

\link ExampleuserPrimaryGenerator userPrimaryGenerator \endlink

This example shows how to create a primary event including several vertices and 
several primary particles per vertex.

\link Examples_HepMC HepMC \endlink

This directory contains examples for using HepMC as an interface with 
various Monte Carlo event generators, such as PYTHIA.
It also include an example for demonstrating MC truth handling with HepMC. 

\link Examples_pythia pythia \endlink

This directory contains examples for using Pythia as Monte Carlo event
generator, interfaced with Geant4, and showing how to implement an external
decayer.
