 History:
 - 10-06-2010 : Makoto Asai - merge into one example
 - 13-05-2010 : Michel Maire - create as three examples
  
 This example demonstrates 5 ways of the usage of G4ParticleGun shooting
 primary particles in different cases. These are
 -#  uniform particle direction in a given solid angle
 -#  Generate several vertices and particles per event
 -#  Show how to sample a tabulated function (eg. energy spectrum)  
 -#  Divergent beam in an arbitrary direction 
 -#  Shooting primaries in spherical coordinates with rotation matrix.

 These usages can be chosen by a UI command
\verbatim 
/gunExample/selectGunAction actionID
\endverbatim 
 where <i>actionID</i> corresponds to above cases.
 	
\section ParticleGun_s1 Geometry construction

 It is a simple box which represents an 'infinite' homogeneous medium.
  
\section ParticleGun_s2 Physics list

PhysicsList.cc defines only geantino and transportation process.
         	
\section ParticleGun_s3 Primary generator

 There are 5 concrete primary generator action classes
 (PrimaryGeneratorActionN, N=0,1,2,3,4) which can be used as an independent sample
 code. 
 PrimaryGeneratorAction is the class which uses and switches between these 
 5 concrete action classes. Each concrete generator action shoots geantinoes
 in a distribution decribed below.
 
\subsection ParticleGun_sub_s30 0. Uniform particle direction in a given solid angle

 spherical angles (alpha,psi) respective to z axis
 Histograms 5,6 show momentum direction in master frame.
 
\subsection ParticleGun_sub_s31 1. Generate several vertices and particles per event

 - particle 1 : a geantino uniformly randomized on a cylinder surface.
 - particle 2 and 3 : symetric to particle 1.
 In addition, time_zero of each event is randomized.
 
\subsection ParticleGun_sub_s32 2. Show how to sample a tabulated function (energy spectrum)

 Energy is sampled from a tabulated function defined in InitFunction().
 The function is assumed positive, linear per segment, continuous.
 Two sampling methods are illustrated : RejectAccept() and InverseCumul()
 (see Particle Data Group: pdg.lbl.gov --> Monte Carlo techniques)

 Histogram 1 shows generated energy spectrum.
       
\subsection ParticleGun_sub_s33 3. Divergent beam in an arbitrary direction with rotation matrix 

 A geantino uniformly randomized around a given direction (theta, phi). 
 One wants to limit particle direction uniformly around this direction.
 First, one generates momentum direction in the master frame (eg. World).
 AlphaMax = opening angle around z axis.
 Then one rotates momentum in local frame, using rotateUz() function.
 RotateUz() transforms uz to newUz. It is composition of two simple rotations:
 theta around oy, then phi around oz (non commutative). \n
 See:
 http://proj-clhep.web.cern.ch/proj-clhep/manual/UserGuide/VectorDefs/node49.html \n
 Histograms 5,6 show momentum direction in local frame.
  
\subsection ParticleGun_sub_s34 4. Shooting primaries in spherical coordinates with rotation matrix

 a geantino uniformly randomized within a spherical shell.

 a) Vertex position
 One wishes to shoot uniformly within a spherical shell.
 One works in spherical coordinates. One uses inverse cumulative method with
 analytical formulae. \n
 Histograms 2,3,4 demonstrate uniform distribution of vertex position.

 b) Momentum direction
 One wants to limit particle direction uniformly within (alphaMin, alphaMax).
 First, one generates momentum direction in the master frame (eg. World).
 Then, one rotates momentum in vertex_position frame, using rotateUz() function.
 RotateUz() transforms uz to ur. It is composition of two elementary rotations:
 theta around oy, then phi around oz (non commutative). \n
 See:
 http://proj-clhep.web.cern.ch/proj-clhep/manual/UserGuide/VectorDefs/node49.html \n
 
 Histograms 5,6 show momentum direction in vertex_position frame.

\section ParticleGun_s4 Visualisation
 
 Visualization Manager is set in the main () (see particleGun.cc).
 Initialisation of the drawing is done via the commands
 /vis/.. in the macro vis.mac. This macro is automatically read from the main 
 in case of interactive running mode.
 
\section ParticleGun_s5 How to start ?
 		
  - Execute particleGun in 'batch' mode from macro files
\verbatim 
% ParticleGun   run1.mac
\endverbatim 
 		
  - Execute particleGun2 in 'interactive mode' with visualization
\verbatim 
% particleGun
....
Idle>      ---> type your commands. For instance:
Idle> /gunExample/selectGunAction 1
Idle> /run/beamOn 10
....
Idle> exit
\endverbatim 
	
\section ParticleGun_s6 Histograms
 
  particleGun produces several 1D histograms which are saved as
  particleGun.root by default.

    - 1 : energy spectrum dN/dE = f(E)
    - 2 : vertex position: radial distr dN/dv = f(r)
    - 3 : vertex position: cos(theta)
    - 4 : vertex position: phi
    - 5 : particle direction in local frame: cos(alpha)
    - 6 : particle direction in local frame: psi      

  Please note that histogram 1 will be filled only if you use 
  PrimaryGeneratorAction2, histos 5,6 with PrimaryGeneratorAction0 and 3
  and 2 through 6 will be filled with PrimaryGeneratorAction4.

  The histograms are managed by the HistoManager class and its Messenger. 
  The histos can be individually activated with the command :
\verbatim 
/analysis/h1/set id nbBins  valMin valMax unit 
\endverbatim 
  where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, deg or mrad, etc..)
   
  One can control the name of the histograms file with the command:
\verbatim 
/analysis/h1/setFileName  name  (default particleGun)
\endverbatim 
   
   It is possible to choose the format of the histogram file : root (default),
   xml, csv, by using namespace in HistoManager.hh
   
   It is also possible to print selected histograms on an ascii file:
\verbatim 
/analysis/h1/setAscii id
\endverbatim 
   All selected histos will be written on a file name.ascii (default gunExample)
