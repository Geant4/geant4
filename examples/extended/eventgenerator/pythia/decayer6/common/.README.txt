  This example includes a set of classes independent on each other which
  can be reused in "feature" examples demonstrating just a particular feature
  or users applications.

  It provides the following sets of classes:

  - Detector construction classes
    - two simple detector construction classes with a messenger

  - Physics list classes
    - GeantinoPhysicsList - physics list with geantino and chargedgeantino only

  - Primary generator classes
    - two simple primary generator classes (with G4ParticleGun and
      G4ParticleGeneralSource)

  These classes can be tested with the following programs:
  - testCommon.cc - only instantiates all classes
  - exampleCommonNoVis.cc - Geant4 application without visualization, that can be run
      both interactively or in batch (with the run.mac macro)
  - exampleCommonNoVis.cc - Geant4 application with visualization, that can be run
      both interactively or in batch (with the run.mac macro)

  Building examples programs can be disabled with the CMake option: -DEXAMPLES_COMMON=OFF.
