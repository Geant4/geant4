/*! \page README_HowToNavigate How to navigate in the examples documentation 

The examples documentation is composed from a <b> "global" documentation </b> including all examples with classes which has unique names (eg. A01DetectorConstruction etc.) and from <b> "standalone" documentations </b>  for examples with classes which names are not not unique (DetectorConstruction etc.).

\section HowToNavigate_sec1 Global documentation

The lists of <a href="pages.html"> "Related Pages" </a> and <a href="modules.html"> "Modules"</a> in the global documentation include the README pages for all examples categories and examples with both unique class names and generic ones. The lists <a href="namespaces.html"> "Namespaces" </a>, <a href="classes.html"> "Classes" </a> and <a href="files.html"> "Files" </a>  include only the examples with unique class names.

That's why the README pages for the examples with a standalone documentation generated in the global documentation do not contain links to their classes 
(one cannot click on a class name here to get the class documentation). See eg. \ref ExampleTestEm1.

\section HowToNavigate_sec2 Standalone documentations

The links from "global" documentation to the examples "standalone" documentation are available in the list of <a href="modules.html"> "Modules"</a>. When selecting eg. "TestEm1" here, you will be directed to <a href="../html_TestEm1/html/index.html"> the main page </a> of its standalone documentation. When selecting then <a href="../html_TestEm1/html/ExampleTestEm1.html"> "Example TestEm1" </a> from the <a href="../html_TestEm1/html/pages.html"> "Related Pages" </a> list here (there is only one page in the list) you will get the example documentation with hyperlinks to the classes etc. 

All the lists in the examples "standalone" documentation include only the concerned example and eventually the classes shared with another examples or the classes from <a href="Examples_common.html"> common </a> if they are used in the example.

This organization was necessary as Doxygen does not support the classes with the same names in one system.
