     =========================================================
     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
     =========================================================

                         Examples module
                         ---------------

This module collects three sets of user examples aimed to demonstrate to
the user how to make correct use of the GEANT4 toolkit by implementing
in a correct way those user-classes which the user is supposed to
customize in order to define his/her own simulation setup.
One set of examples is oriented to "novice" users and covering all
possible general use-cases typical of an "application"-oriented kind of
development. An "extended" set of examples require some additional
libraries besides of Geant4. This set covers some specific use cases
for actual detector simulation. An "advanced" set of examples covers
the use-cases typical of a "toolkit"-oriented kind of development,
where real complete applications for different simulation studies are
provided; may require additional third party products to be built.
Most of the examples can be run both in interactive and batch mode, and 
input macro files (*.in) and reference output files (*.out) are provided.
Novice and most of the extended examples are considered part of the
system testing suite for validation of the official releases of the
GEANT4 toolkit. Novice examples and some of the extended and advanced
examples are also used as "acceptance"-tests for the release process.
