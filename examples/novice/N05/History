                    Example N05 History file
                    ------------------------
This file should be used by the G4 example coordinator to briefly
summarize all major modifications introduced in the code and keep
track of all tags.

August 03, 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (exampleN05-V02-00-01r)
- Changed RandGauss to G4RandGauss in ExN05PionShowerModel.cc to fix problem
  of events' reproducibility.

July 28, 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (exampleN05-V02-00-01)
- Includes also new ExN05VisManager class.

June 26, 2000  John Allison  (exampleN05-V02-00-00)
- Reduced no. of events per run from 500 to 250 in exampleN05.large_N.in.

June 24, 2000  John Allison  (exampleN05-V01-01-01)
- Updated exampleN05.out for stand-V01-01-05 and utils-V01-01-03.

June 17, 2000  John Allison  (exampleN05-V01-01-00)
- Updated exampleN05.out for geant4-01-01-ref-06.

23th April 1999 H.Kurashige
- Remove ConstructHad and ConstructLeptHad in ExN05PhysicsList

16th April 1999 H.Kurashige
- modify ExN05RunAction  ExN05SteppingAction ExN05TrackingAction
- modify ExN05PhysicsList::SetCuts

11 December 1998 M. Verderi
- fix made in ExN05CalorimeterSD to allow several instanciations of this class.
  The problem was a static variable (HCID) used in EndOfEventAction which made
  confusion to get the hits collection. HCID is now put as private (non static!) 
  member of the class.
- the example.in/.out are updated accordingly


9 December 1998 M. Verderi
- Added ExN05PionShowerModel: a model producing hits
  for pi+/pi-
- Modify ExN05EMShowerModel to produce a "less unrealistic"
  shower shape: now the longitudinal profile is according to
  the Gamma distribution. Transverse profile is two cylinder:
  the 1 moliere radius receive 90% of the energy, the 3.5 one
  receives the rest.
- Added RandomGamma: shoot at random according to the Gamma
  distribution. Adapted from RNGAMA function of KERNLIB.
  (thanks to D. Bernard who gave me the source).
- ExN05DetectorConstruction. Many changes:
	- EM calo size reduced, crytals also;
	- addition of an hadronic calorimeter
	- addition of a ghost volume
  The G4VFastSimulationModel are instanciated(?) here, and
  no more in exampleN05.cc
- exampleN05.in modified to shoot pions in order to test
  the ghost geometry.
- ExN05PhysicsList modified to add the parameterisation
  process as a Post&Along process, because of the ghost.



16th August 1998 H.Kurashige
- Added ExN05MinRangeCuts, ExN05MinEkineCuts, ExN05MaxTimeCuts
  and their base class of ExN05SpecialCuts for using UserLimits.
- Modified ExN05PhysicsList to register above processes.
- Modified ExN05DetectorConstruction to attach Userlimits to crystal.
- Added ExN05DetectorMessenger to switch on/off UserLimits.
- Modified exampleN05.in 
 

9th August 1998  John Allison
- Changed G4UIterminal to G4UIGAG.

16th July 1998  John Allison
- Changed /vis~/Draw... to /vis~/draw.

June 26th 98 Marc Verderi:

Remove previous files, and add new ones with the
good (hopefully) naming conventions this time.
Improvements done in ExN05EMShowerModel by using
a private navigator, rather than the one for tracking.
