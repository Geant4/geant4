This file should be used by the G4 example coordinator to briefly
summarize all major modifications introduced in the code and keep
track of all tags.

06-02-01 M.Asai (exampleN03-V03-00-01)
- Migration to STL vector classes
 affected : ExN03SteppingVerbose.cc

4th February 2001 Steve O'Neale (tagset254)

21-11-27, Satoshi Tanake (exampleN03-V02-00-04)
- The macro initInter.mac (by Michel) is revised.
  1) The command "/vis/scene/create" is removed, 
     since it is already included in "/vis/drawVolume".
  2) /vis/viewer/update is added, since it becomes necessary 
     when the OpenGL driver is switched to another driver.
- In visTutor/exN03Vis5,6.mac (by Guy) 
   "/vis/include/trajectories" is renamed into 
   "/vis/scene/add/trajectories" and also commented out. 
  (All other "/vis/scene/add/trajectories"'s are already commented out 
   by Michel, since the C++ method DrawTrajectory() is now described 
   in the event action.
- Unnecessary "/vis/scene/create" are removed from 
  visTutor/exN03VisX.mac when it is already included in 
  "/vis/drawVolume" or "/vis/specify". 
- The command /vis/camera/viewpoint is removed from visTutor/exN03Vis0.mac
  in order to avoid crushing in reading it in execution of 
  the G4 executable: $(G4BINDIR)/exampleN03 exN03Vis0.mac .
- Comments updated in visTutor/exN03VisX.mac.


25th November 2000 Steve O'Neale (tagset210)
- Update test outputs for min.delta energy cut
- Update test outputs for energy cut table only for e- and gamma
- Update test outputs for new tags in em processes.
  Note we skip round work in progress
     
21-11-00, mma (exampleN03-V02-00-02)
- introduce G4UItcsh in exampleN03.cc
- put all vis macros in a new subdirectory visTutor
- prerunN03 simplified (compound vis commands) and renamed initInter.mac
- code to control the drawing of tracks reinstalled in eventAction
- bug corrected in PhysicsList::GetCutForProton()
- PrimaryGenerator : default particle e- 50 MeV 

October 19, 2000  Satoshi Tanaka  (exampleN03-V02-00-01)
- Updated exN03Vis0-4.mac, incorporating recent development 
  of vis commands
- Updated format of comments in exN03Vis0-4.mac.
- Created exN03Vis7.mac: demo of the VRMLFILE driver
- Created exN03Vis8.mac: demo of multi-page PS file generation

- Updated exampleN03.out for geant4-01-01-ref-06.

14 June 2000 John Allison (exampleN03-V01-01-07)
- Added #ifdef G4UI_USE_XM to protect #include "G4UIXm.hh" in exampleN03.cc.
- Limit output in gui.mac (Guy Barrand).

13 June 2000 Guy Barrand (exampleN03-V01-01-06)
- exampleN03.cc, prerunN03.mac : 
  put execution of the gui.mac in exampleN03.cc
  with an #ifdef G4UI_USE_XM protection and
  remove it from preunN03.mac. This will gurantee
  no effect of the gui.mac on other G4UI sessions.
- g4Xt.xrm : add a resource to limit contant
  of XmText widgets (in particular the one used
  to dump G4cout things).
- exaN03Vis5.6.mac : remove commands that are
  in fact not supported by Xo and Invnetor
  drivers.

09 June 2000 Satoshi Tanaka (exampleN03-V01-01-05) :
- In  prerunN03, 
  < /vis/scene/include/trajectories
  ---
  > /vis/scene/add/trajectories                                                  
09 June 2000 Guy Barrand (exampleN03-V01-01-04) :
- correct some comments in exN03Vis5,6.mac.
- add gui.mac.
- trigger execution of gui.mac at end of prerunN03.mac.

09 June 2000 Guy Barrand (exampleN03-V01-01-02) :
- add exN03Vis4,5.mac for a simple example
  of OPACS/Xo and Inventor driver.

09th June 2000 Satoshi Tanaka  (exampleN03-V01-01-01)
- exNO3VisX.mac's are updated corresponding to recent 
  development of the new vis commands:  
  (1) Compound commands are used wherever possible.
  (2) Ordering of commands and comments are rewritten 
      to improve readability.
  (3) exN03Vis4.mac is created to demonstrate 
      the compound command  "/vis/specify". 

05-06-00 M.Maire
- cleanup of ExN03EventAction to limit the amount of output with
  exampleN03.large_N.in
  
20th May 2000 Satoshi Tanaka 
- exNO3VisX.mac's are updated corresponding to development 
  of the new vis commands.
- The command /vis/add/trajectories is added to exNO3VisX.mac's.
  Instead the C++ method "DrawTrajectory()" is removed from 
  ExN03EventAction::EndOfEventAction(). 

19th May 2000 Satoshi Tanaka 
- g4.xrm (Xt resource file for UI) is renamed to g4Xt.xrm

11th May 2000 Satoshi Tanaka (examples-V01-01-03)
