                    Example N02 History file
                    ------------------------
This file should be used by the G4 example coordinator to briefly
summarize all major modifications introduced in the code and keep
track of all tags.

     * Reverse chronological order (last date on top), please *
     ----------------------------------------------------------

31-02-05 S.O'Neale (exampleN02-V03-00-01)
- update reference output for Batch Mode system testing for
  exampleN02-V03-00-00 and recent EM Physics tags.

31-01-01 G.Cosmo (exampleN02-V03-00-00)
- fix to ExN02ChamberParameterisation and ExN02DetectorConstruction
  to cope with bug report #186. Parameterisation of chambers was not
  taking into account that copyNo starts from 0, therefore dimensions
  of the first chamber (parametrised G4Box) were set to negative values (!).
  This was causing the side-effect of visualising a "ghost" chamber (the
  first one close to the target), which was correctly not seen by tracking.
  Therefore, number of chambers is now reduced to 5 but global positioning
  and parameters have been preserved.

06-12-00 S.O'Neale (exampleN02-V02-00-03)
- update reference output for Batch Mode system testing
  in this context 0 trajectories stored is normal.

03-12-00 M.Maire (exampleN02-V02-00-02)
- README updated
- prerun.g4mac updated for new vis commands, and renamed initInter.mac
- new examples of macro: run1.mac, run2.mac
- G4UItcsh in the main, under the control of G4UI_USE_TCSH (for Linux)
- visualisation on interactive mode
- DetectorConstruction: tracker region in the centre of the world.
  default target material: Pb, chamber material: Xenon
- interactive commands to change the materials and to setup a magnetic field
- the magnetic field is transverse to the beam (i.e. along x)
- PhysicsList: copy of N03. defaultCut = 1 cm
- PrimaryGenerator: default momentum direction corrected: along z.
  Suppress the possibility of random impact and the associated messenger.
- RunAction and EventAction updated for vis commands
- SteppingAction: cleanup because no specific actions
- SteppingVerbose: see README
- TrackerHit: a Hit = 4 informations: trackID, chamberNb, edep, position.
  Draw and Print
- TrackerSD: ProcessHits.
  Print HitsCollection at end of event 

25th November 2000 Steve O'Neale (tagset210)
- Update test outputs for min.delta energy cut
- Update test outputs for emlowen-V02-00-22 and stand,muon,xray,utils.

Nov 09, 2000  V.Grichine     (exampleN02-V02-00-00)
- Fix in ExN02MagneticField constructors: added call to SetDetectorField()
  to activate user-defined magnetic-field.
- Updated exampleN02.out.

June 24, 2000  John Allison  (exampleN02-V01-01-03)

June 19, 2000  G.Cosmo  (exampleN02-V01-01-01)
- Fixed length of detector box to include tracker in ExN02DetectorConstruction.
- Cosmetic changes to comments.

June 17, 2000  John Allison  (exampleN02-V01-01-00)

 4th December 1998 John Apostolakis
