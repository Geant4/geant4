/*! \page README_HowToRun How to build and run an example

All novice, basic and most of extended examples have a similar structure.
The main () function is included in \em exampleXYZ.cc in the example top directory
and the example source code is structered in \em include and \em src subdirectories.
When the example is built, the executable takes the same name as the file with
main () function without \em .cc extension, \em exampleXYZ.

Then several macros are provided to run the example with various start-up
conditions. These macros have usually \em .mac extension. Besides these macros,
there is often a macro \em exampleXYZ.in (note its different extension)
which is used in Geant4 testing and which output, \em exampleXYZ.out, can be also included
in the distribution.

You can find all details about building the examples in the <a href= "http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/UserDocumentation/UsersGuides/InstallationGuide/html/index.html"> Geant4 Installation Guide </a>, in the section <a href="http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/UserDocumentation/UsersGuides/InstallationGuide/html/ch03s02.html">  3.2. Building Applications with Geant4 </a>.
Here we recall only the basics. 

\section HowToRun_s1 Compile and link to generate an executable

\subsection HowToRun_subs11 With CMake
\verbatim
% cd path_to_exampleXYZ     # go to directory which contains your example
% mkdir exampleXYZ_build
% cd exampleXYZ_build
% cmake -DGeant4_DIR=path_to_Geant4_installation/lib[64]/Geant4-9.6.0/ ../exampleXYZ
% make -j N exampleXYZ      # "N" is the number of processes 
% make install              # this step is optional              
\endverbatim

\subsection  HowToRun_subs12 With GNUmake 

To use GNUmake build system when Geant4 was installed with CMake, you have to source first
the setup script in order to define needed environment variables:
\verbatim
source path_to_Geant4_installation/share/Geant4-9.6.0/geant4make/geant4make.[c]sh 
\endverbatim

Then to build example
\verbatim
% cd path_to_exampleXYZ/exampleXYZ
% gmake
\endverbatim

An additional step is needed when building an example using shared classes
(usually from ../shared directory) or classes from 
\link Examples_common common \endlink:
\verbatim
% cd path_to_exampleXYZ/exampleXYZ
% gmake setup
% gmake
\endverbatim

When building the example in this way make sure that the path to the example executable and its shared library is added in the paths defined on your system (eg. PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux). 

\section HowToRun_s2 Execute exampleXYZ in 'batch' mode from macro files
 		
\verbatim
... go to the directory where the example was built/installed
% exampleXYZ  xyz.mac
\endverbatim
 		
\section HowToRun_s3 Execute exampleXYZ in 'interactive mode' with visualization
\verbatim
... go to the directory where the example was built/installed
% exampleXYZ
....
Idle> type your commands
....
Idle> exit
\endverbatim

/*! \page README_HowToRunTestEm1 How to build and run TestEm1 example

Below we give the explicit instructions (described in general at \ref README_HowToRun page) for the example extended/electromagnetic/TestEm1.

Let's suppose that the \em TestEm1 directory is available in $HOME and Geant4 installation in \em /usr/local and we work within the \em bash shell on a \em 64-bit machine.

\section HowToRunTestEm1_s1 Compile and link TestEm1 to generate an executable

\subsection HowToRunTestEm1_subs11 With CMake
\verbatim
% cd $HOME
% mkdir TestEm1_build
% cd TestEm1_build
% cmake -DGeant4_DIR=/usr/local/lib64/Geant4-9.6.0/ ../TestEm1
% make -j 2 TestEm1
\endverbatim

\subsection HowToRunTestEm1_subs12 With GNUmake
\verbatim
% cd $HOME/TestEm1
% source /usr/local/share/Geant4-9.6.0/geant4make/geant4make.sh
% make 
\endverbatim

\section HowToRunTestEm1_s2 Execute TestEm1 in 'batch' mode from macro files
\verbatim
% cd $HOME/TestEm1_build    # or cd $HOME/TestEm1 if example was built with GNUmake
% TestEm1 annihil.mac
% TestEm1 brem.mac
% TestEm1 TestEm1.in >& myTestEm1.out   # redirecting output in a file
\endverbatim
 		
\section HowToRunTestEm1_s3 Execute TestEm1 in 'interactive mode' with visualization
\verbatim
% cd $HOME/TestEm1_build    # or cd $HOME/TestEm1 if example was built with GNUmake
% TestEm1
PreInit> /run/initialize 
Idle>    /run/beamOn 1
...
Idle>    exit
\endverbatim
