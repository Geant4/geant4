----> Introduction.                                                     
                                                                       
Brachytherapy example simulates  the energy deposit in a water phantom, produced by: 
<<<<<<< HEAD
1) Iridium source (endocavitary brachytherapy).                         
2) Iodium  source (interstitial brachytherapy).                         
3) Leipzig Applicator (superficial brachytherapy).   
=======
1) Iridium sources (Flexisource and TG186).                     
2) Iodine sources (Bebig Isoseed and Oncura 6711 I-125).           
3) Leipzig Applicator with an iridium source (model from the Istituto Tumori, Genova, Italy).   

The Flexisource, an Ir-192 source manufactured by Nucletron, an Elekta company, is a source commonly used for high dose rate brachytherapy treatments. 
The geometry of the Flexisource was adapted from D. Granero, J. Pérez-Calatayud, E. Casal, et al, 
"A dosimetric study on the Ir-192 high dose rate Flexisource", Med. Phys. 33 (12), 2006, 4578-82.

The TG186 source is a generic Ir-192 source created to provide developers of model based dose engines with a method of validating new dose calculation techniques.
Details of the TG186 source may be obtained from Facundo Ballester, Åsa Carlsson Tedgren, Domingo Granero, et al,
"A generic high-dose rate 192Ir brachytherapy source for evaluation of model-based dose calculations beyond the TG-43 formalism", Med. Phys. 42, 2015, 3048-62

In particular in this example it is shown how to:
- model a radioactive source  in terms of radiation field and geometry
- model the radiation field with the General Particle Source   
- calculate the energy deposition in a phantom by means of the G4 scoring mesh
- define the physics by means of a Geant4 Modular Physics List
<<<<<<< HEAD
- switch different physics approaches to model electromagnetic physics
- save results in an analysis ROOT file using the Geant4 analysis component.               
=======
- save results in an analysis ROOT file              
- calculate the dose rate distribution along the main axis of the source
- compare the calculated dose rate distribution to reference data. 

In the case of the example, the dose rate distribution of a Flexisource is compared to D. Granero, 
J. Pérez-Calatayud, E. Casal, et al,"A dosimetric study on the Ir-192 high dose rate Flexisource", Med. Phys. 33 (12), 2006, 4578-82. 
The dose rate distribution of the Oncura 6711 I-125 source is compared to J. Dolan, Z. Lia, J. F. Williamson, "Monte Carlo and experimental
dosimetry of an I-125 brachytherapy seed", Med. Phys. 33(12), 2006.

A standard Geant4 example CMakeLists.txt is provided.                   

Setup for analysis:
By default, the example has no analysis component. 

To compile and use the application with the analysis on, build the example with the following command:
cmake -DWITH_ANALYSIS_USE=ON -DGeant4_DIR=/path/to/Geant4_installation /path/to/brachytherapy_example

macro.C and plot_primary.C are provided to plot the results of the simulation, contained
in the brachytherapy.root file.

----> 4. Primary radiation Field

The radiation field is defined with the General Particle Source.

Two alternative options are offered:
1) Define gamma as primary radiation field. The gamma are originated from the radioactive core.
This radiation field is defined in:
iodine_source_primary.mac and iridium_source_primary.mac

2) Model the radioactive Decay. The primary particle is the radionuclide.
<<<<<<< HEAD
This option is modelled in iodine_decay.mac and iridium_decay.mac
=======
This option is modelled in iodine_decay.mac and TG186_iridium_decay.mac

The GPS macros are executed in VisualisationMacro.mac by default, FlexiSourceMacro.mac, IodineSourceMacro.mac, LeipzigSourceMacro.mac

- The Flexisource is the default source of the example.
- In VisualisationMacro.mac the source is the default one. iridium_source_primary.mac is executed to define the radiation field emerging from the iridium core.
- In FlexiSourceMacro.mac the Flexi Ir source geometry is selected via interactive command. The radiation field is defined in the iridium_source_primary.mac.
- In IodineSourceMacro.mac, the Bebig Isoseed I-125  brachytherapy source  is modelled. The radiation field is modelled in terms of emitted photons in iodine_source_primary.mac. 
  Alternatively the radioactive decay of I can be modelled using teh macro iodine_decay.mac.
- In LeipzigSourceMacro.mac, A Leipzig applicator (design provided by Istituto Tumori, Genova) is modelled. The iridium_source_leipzig_primary.mac defines the radiation field of the Ir core.
- The TG186SourceMacro.mac models the reference bIr brachytherapy source. The radiation field can be either defined with the iridium_source_primary.mac (spectrum of the emitted photons) or with TG186_iridium_decay.mac (model of the Ir decay).
- OncuraIodineSourceMacro.mac models both the geometry and the radioactive decay of the Oncura 6711 I-125 source.

----> 5. Physics List

The electromagnetic Livermore Low Energy physics is active as well as the radioactive decay.
The cut is 0.05 mm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
----> 5. Scoring mesh

The scoring mesh is used to calculate the energy deposition in the voxels of the phantom,
integrated over the whole run. The scoring mesh is defined in the input macro file (see IridiumSourceMacro.mac for example).
The user can change the default output format of the scoring in the class BrachyUserScoreWriter.

The output is:

- ASCII file EnergyDeposition.out, with xx (mm), yy(mm), zz(mm), and energy deposition (keV), in the phantom.
  By default:
<<<<<<< HEAD

A macro is provided ad example of visualisation:  VisualisationMacro.mac. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----> 9. Comparison to reference data

The ROOT macros macro.C and plot_primary.C are provided to plot the results of the simulation, contained
in the brachytherapy.root file. 

The ROOT macro TG43_relative_dose.C has brachytherapy.root as input file. It calculates the dose rate distribution along the main axis of 
the brachytherapy source. The dose rate is normalised to 1 at 1 cm distance from the centre. 
The output file is geant4_dose.txt with two columns: 
distance from the centre (cm) dose rate distribution

The user can then compare the dose rate distribution calculated with the example to reference data.

Directory "comparison":
As an example, the dose rate distribution calculated with the Flexisource is compared to reference data from D. Granero, J. Pérez-Calatayud, E. Casal, et al,  "A dosimetric study on the Ir-192 high dose rate Flexisource", Med. Phys. 33 (12), 2006, 4578-82.
