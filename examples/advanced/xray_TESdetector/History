# Example Xray_TESdetector History

See `CONTRIBUTING.rst` for details of **required** info/format for each entry,
which **must** added in reverse chronological order (newest at the top). It must **not**
be used as a substitute for writing good git commit messages!

## 2023-11-15 I. Hrivnacova (xraytesdetector-V11-01-03)
- Updated vis.mac:
  - Changed "/vis/open XYZ [600x600-0+0]" to "/vis/open" to allow run-time choices
    and simplified comments.

## 2023-11-10 A.Ribon (xraytesdetector-V11-01-02)
- run02.mac : introduced the UI command
  '/process/had/rdm/thresholdForVeryLongDecayTime 1.0e+60 year'
  to allow all radioactive decays (including the very long ones).
  This is necessary since G4 11.2, being 1 year the default time
  threshold above which the decays are ignored.
  Note: in run01.mac, the above UI command is commented out
        because system testing is running with the physics 
        G4EmStandard_SpacePhysics and HadronInelasticQBBC, therefore without
        radioactive decay (hence the command would be undefined).

## 2023-03-27 R.Stanzani (xraytesdetector-V11-01-01)
- Add vis manager

## 2023-03-16 R.Stanzani (xraytesdetector-V11-01-00)
- First commit for the Xray_TESdetector example
