Simulation of the TIARA experiment using importance sampling
============================================================

This example is a simulation of the neutron shielding experiment TIARA
see http://idsun1.kek.jp/nakao/research/tiara/tiara.htm.
The example is meant to provide a realistic example for
applying geometrical importance sampling (geometrical splitting and 
Russian roulette).
In the TIARA experiment neutrons of two different energy distributions 
created by 43 MeV and 68 MeV protons bombarding a 7Li target are measured
behind several shields. The simulation starts from the neutron spectra.
In this example the interactions of the neutrons with the (concrete) 
shields are simulated and energy dependent neutron fluxes are measured 
behind the shields. Users may chose to run the simulation for different 
shielding configuration with or without importance sampling.
The simulated neutron fluxes are compared to the published 
experimental data. The efficiency of applying importance sampling
depends strongly on the shield thickness and importance configuration.
The efficiency of the simulations may be obtained as FOM values.

For Application Developers", Chapter "Toolkit Fundamentals"
Section  "Event Biasing Techniques" and references there.

The example has been tested on CERN RH 7.3 with the
gcc-3.2 and gcc-2.95.2 compilers.

Note for system testing without analysis: see points 1, 1.3 and 3.2.




1) Setting the environment
==========================

You must compile Geant4 with:
   "G4LIB_BUILD_SHARED" set to 1.
You need to set:
   "NeutronHPCrossSections" (e.g. to ${G4INSTALL}/data/G4NDL3.7)


Three examples are given of how to set environment variables
in the three cases:

1.1) Anaphe via AFS (most simple):
--------------------
   You have access to afs and you want to use Anaphe for the
   analysis: 
   Set the following environment variables:
   "G4ANALYSIS_USE"

   "ANAPHETOP" (e.g. /afs/cern.ch/sw/lhcxx)
   "AIDA_DIR"  (e.g. /afs/cern.ch/sw/contrib/AIDA/3.0/src/cpp)
   "ANAPHE_SCRIPTS" (e.g. /afs/cern.ch/sw/lhcxx/share/LHCXX/5.0.6/scripts)

   Finally source the script envCommon.csh from the directory
   you have Tiara installed, e.g. ${G4INSTALL}/examples/advanced/Tiara


1.2) No afs but a local Anaphe and AIDA installation:
-----------------------------------------------------
   You don't use afs but you have a local installation of Anaphe and AIDA
   (e.g. from http://anaphe.web.cern.ch/anaphe/.
   Set the following environment variables:
   "G4ANALYSIS_USE"
 
   "ANAPHETOP" (e.g. <directory>/Anaphe/release)
   "AIDA_DIR"  (e.g. <directory>/AIDA/3.0.0/3.0.0/AIDA/3.0/src/cpp)
   "ANAPHE_SCRIPTS" (e.g. ${ANAPHETOP}/share/LHCXX/5.0.6/scripts)

      here <directory> is a place holder for your directory with the
      respective installations of Anaphe and AIDA

   Finally source the script envCommon.csh from the directory
   you have Tiara installed, e.g. ${G4INSTALL}/examples/advanced/Tiara


1.3) No afs, no Anaphe and no AIDA (e.g. for system testing):
-------------------------------------------------------------
   You don't want to use Anaphe and AIDA and you don't have afs access.
   Make sure "G4ANALYSIS_USE" is unset (e.g. unsetenv G4ANALYSIS_USE).

   Note: python must be built against a "libc". 
         You may do this by creating a shared library by a command
         similar to this 
         "ld -shared -o libpython2.2.so --whole-archive libpython2.2.a /usr/lib/libc.so"

   Set the following environment variables:
   "PYTHONVERSION" (2.2 or higher)
   "PYTHON_BASE_DIR" (e.g. to  /usr)
   "SWIG_VERSION" (e.g. 1.3 or higher)
   "SWIG_BASE_DIR" (e.g. /usr)
   "CLHEP_BASE_DIR" (e.g. to  /opt/local)

   Finally source the script envCommon.csh from the directory
   you have Tiara installed, e.g. ${G4INSTALL}/examples/advanced/Tiara


2) Building the example
=======================

Geant4 has to be compiled using G4LIB_BUILD_SHARED 1 and the one of the 
above environment settings have to be set.

Type "gmake".


2.1) In more detail
-------------------

Geant4 must be compiled into granular shared libraries.
Therefore before compiling Geant4 set "G4LIB_BUILD_SHARED" to "1".

External packages used in this example are Anaphe, SWIG and Python.
The Anaphe package comes with SWIG and Python versions used to build
Anaphe itself. These SWIG and Python versions should also be used with 
this example if Anaphe is used. 


2.2) Cleaning up
----------------
To remove the files created by swig ( *_wrap.cc, the corresponding 
.py files) use "gmake swigClean".
To remove the directories of compiled code related to this example under 
$G4WORKDIR/tmp/$G4SYSTEM/ use "gmake tiaraClean".


3) Running the example:
=======================


3.1) Using Anaphe
-----------------
Change to the sub directory "run" and execute "runSim.py".
"runSim.py" runs an example configuration which nay be
changed by the user. The results of the simulation are stored in 
the directory "simData". 
The script "runSim.py" periodically prints scoring information to the 
screen. 
It also prints out the relative path of a ".shelve" file.
This file can be used to access results of the simulation.

In case the example was build using analysis
results may be viewed e.g. using lizard and scripts:
1) Start python2.2 or lizard
2) type: import dataAcess
3) type: p = dataAcess.ExpMcPlot (shelveFileName,detectorposition)
         where "shelveFileName" is the name (enclosed in quotes) of the
         shelve file created during the execution of runSim.py. 
         The name is printed on the screen during execution of runSim.py.
         "detectorposition" may be "00, "20" or "40" and stand for the 
         detectors 00, 20, 40 cm off beam axis respectively. 
4) type: p.display ()
5) type: import extractShelve
6) type: extractShelve.getFluxes (p.she)
         p.she is the shelve object containing simulation results.
         This prints the FOM values for the used detectors
         for two energy regions below and in the peak region.
         The FOM should be compared to unbiased simulations. To run 
         an unbiased simulation set the importance values to one (see  
         runSim.py)
  
Note: the output files written after every run are incremental! Meaning 
      the file with the highest run number contains the data from 
      all the runs!

The modules (dataAcess, extractShelve) imported in the above steps are 
placed in source/py_modules in files named after the module ending with 
".py".

Since the simulation time used by "runSim.py" is only 5 minutes the
calculated results have large errors. If you want to see a better result
do the following changes in "naSim.py".
Extend the total run time to e,g, 2 hours by setting:
"totalTime = 2 * myUtils.hour", 
set the print out period to 30 minutes by setting:
"timeForOneRun = 30 * myUtils.min".




3.2) Not using Anaphe (mainly for system testing)
-------------------------------------------------
Change to the sub directory "run" and execute 
runSimNoAnalysis.py.

5) Technicalities about this example
===================================

 This example is composed out of a layer of classes written in C++
(source/tiara/include, source/tiara/src), a layer of python
shadow classes created by swig (source/CLHEPWrapper, 
source/G4KernelWrapper, source/TiaraWrapper) and a layer of 
python modules (source/py_modules). 
 The C++ layer under source/tiara provides lower level classes closely
related to the Geant4 kernel. 
 The shadow classes in the source/*Wrapper directories provide classes 
that may be instantiated in a python script or session. This way the 
lower level C++ code can be used directly for scripting in python. The 
shadow classes are declared in the files with extensions ".i" in the 
source/*Wrapper/include directories. Swig is used to create C++ code for 
a library that can be loaded into python and python modules (files with 
extensions .py in the source/*Wrapper directories). When the python 
modules created by swig are imported into python (in a session or a 
script) the corresponding C++ library is automatically loaded as well.
 The python modules in source/py_modules provide classes and functions
that may be changed or customized more frequently than the C++ classes
in source/tiara. These classes complete the construction of geometries,
take care of the procedure of setting up the simulation, the run sequence
and the analysis after the simulation has been ran.
 The script runSim.py is an commented example of using the python modules
to run a simulation.
