---->0. INTRODUCTION.                                                    
                                                                       
The microelectronics example simulates the track of a 5 MeV proton in silicon. 
Geant4 standard EM models are used in the World volume while Geant4-MicroElec models
are used in a Target volume, declared as a Region.

---->1. GEOMETRY SET-UP.
 
By default, the geometry is a 2 um side cube (World) made of silicon containing 
a smaller cubic Target volume of silicon (1 um3). 
The target material can be modified and simulated with G4MicroElecPhysics processes.

---->2. SET-UP 
                                                                        
Make sure that the G4EMLOW database version is correct (> or = 7.16)

The variable G4ANALYSIS_USE must be set to 1.
  
The code should be compiled with cmake: 
    $ mkdir microelectronics-build
    $ cd microelectronics-build
    $ cmake -DGeant4_DIR=/your_path/geant4-install/ $PATHTOMICROELECEXAMPLE/microelectronics
    $ make

It works in MT mode (but in this example today MT=1 due to memory consumption of new Microelec models).

---->3. HOW TO RUN THE EXAMPLE                                         

In interactive mode, run:

./microelectronics

The macro microelectronics.mac is executed by default. 

To get visualization, make sure to uncomment the #/control/execute vis.mac
 line in the macro.

 By default, the new MicroElec models are used. 
 You can used the Silicon MicroElec models, with the "-onlySi" option:
 ./microelectronics -onlySi
or
./microelectronics microelectronics.mac -onlySi

You can change the type of the target material 
(G4_Ag G4_Al G4_C G4_Cu G4_Ge G4_KAPTON G4_Ni G4_Si G4_SILICON_DIOXIDE G4_Ti G4_W), 
if you uncomment one line (/microelectronics/det/setMat) into the .mac file. 



---->4. PHYSICS

This example shows:
- how to use the G4MicroElecPhysics and G4MicroElecSiPhysics processes, 
- how to affect them a name
- how to combine them with Standard EM Physics.

A simple electron capture process is also provided in order to kill electrons 
below a chosen energy threshold, set in the Physics list.

Look at the G4MicroElecSiPhysics.cc (previous silicon MicroElec models)
and G4MicroElecPhysics.cc (new MicroElec models) files.

---->5. SIMULATION OUTPUT AND RESULT ANALYZIS                                    

The output results consists in a microelectronics.root file, containing for each simulation step:
- the type of particle for the current step
- the type of process for the current step
- the track position of the current step (in nanometers)
- the energy deposit along the current step (in eV)
- the step length (in nm)
- the total enery loss along the current step (in eV)

This file can be easily analyzed using for example the provided ROOT macro 
file plot.C; to do so :
* be sure to have ROOT installed on your machine
* be sure to be in the microelectronics directory
* launch ROOT by typing root
* under your ROOT session, type in : .X plot.C to execute the macro file
* alternatively you can type directly under your session : root plot.C

The naming scheme on the displayed ROOT plots is as follows (see SteppingAction.cc):

-particles:
e-       : 1    
proton   : 2
ion 	 : 3

-processes:
e-_G4MicroElecElastic		11
e-_G4MicroElecInelastic		12
eCapture			13

p_G4MicroElecInelastic		14

ion_G4MicroElecInelastic	15

hIoni				16
eIoni				17

G4MicroElecPhysics parameters:
e-_G4LOPhononScattering         19
e-_G4MicroElecSurface           20
alpha_G4Dielectrics             21
ion_G4Dielectrics               22
