---->0. INTRODUCTION.                                                    
                                                                       
The microelectronics example simulates the track of a 5 MeV proton in silicon. 
Geant4 standard EM models are used in the World volume while Geant4-MicroElec models
are used in a Target volume, declared as a Region.

---->1. GEOMETRY SET-UP.
 
The geometry is a 1 um side cube (World) made of silicon containing a smaller cubic Target volume of silicon.

---->2. SET-UP 
                                                                        
Make sure G4LEDATA points to the low energy electromagnetic libraries.

The variable G4ANALYSIS_USE must be set to 1.
  
The code should be compiled with cmake: 
    $ cd $HOME
    $ mkdir microelectronics-build
    $ cd $HOME/microelectronics-build
    $ cmake -DGeant4_DIR=/your_path/geant4-install/lib64/Geant4-9.5.0 $HOME/microelectronics
    $ make

It works in MT mode.

---->3. HOW TO RUN THE EXAMPLE                                         

In interactive mode, run:

./Microelectronics

The macro microelectronics.mac is executed by default. 

To get visualization, make sure to uncomment the #/control/execute vis.mac
 line in the macro.

---->4. PHYSICS

This example shows:
- how to use the Geant4-MicroElec processes, 
- how to affect them a name
- how to combine them with Standard EM Physics.

A simple electron capture process is also provided in order to kill electrons 
below a chosen energy threshold, set in the Physics list.

Look at the PhyscisList.cc file.

---->5. SIMULATION OUTPUT AND RESULT ANALYZIS                                    

The output results consists in a microelectronics.root file, containing for each simulation step:
- the type of particle for the current step
- the type of process for the current step
- the track position of the current step (in nanometers)
- the energy deposit along the current step (in eV)
- the step length (in nm)
- the total enery loss along the current step (in eV)

This file can be easily analyzed using for example the provided ROOT macro 
file plot.C; to do so :
* be sure to have ROOT installed on your machine
* be sure to be in the microelectronics directory
* launch ROOT by typing root
* under your ROOT session, type in : .X plot.C to execute the macro file
* alternatively you can type directly under your session : root plot.C

The naming scheme on the displayed ROOT plots is as follows (see SteppingAction.cc):

-particles:
e-       : 1    
proton   : 2
ion 	 : 3

-processes:
e-_G4MicroElecElastic		11
e-_G4MicroElecInelastic		12
eCapture			13

p_G4MicroElecInelastic		14

ion_G4MicroElecInelastic	15

hIoni				16
eIoni				17
