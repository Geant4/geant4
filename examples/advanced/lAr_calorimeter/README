                             lArCal 
                            --------


This example is intended to simulate the Liquid Argon Calorimeter
of the ATLAS Detector at LHC. 

1. GEOMETRY DEFINITION
------------------------

The liquid Argon calorimeter consists of two modules; an electromagnetic 
and a hadronic one whose geometry parameters are defined in 
FCALEMModuleParameters.input and FCALHadModuleParameters.input files.
It contains a FCALTestbemSetup class whose geometry is given by 
FCALTestbeamSetupParameters.input. See these files for details concerning to
radius, lenght and angles of the different components. 


2.  AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR
------------------------------------ 
    
 The primary kinematic consists of a single particle which hits the
 geometry perpendicular to the input face. The FCALPrimaryGeneratorAction 
 class  gives the particle and its energy (by default it is an electron of
 80 GeV). Theses parameters can be changed in commands of ParticleGun class
 inside the macros given in this example. 
 
 The subdirectory data-tracks contains the kinematic files 
 of the particles for different energies (20 GeV, 40 GeV, 60 GeV, 80 GeV, 
 120 GeV and 200 GeV). 
 The information given inside these files are the X, Y, Z and cosX, 
 cosY, cosZ variables for each event. 

  A RUN is a set of events.
 	

3. VISUALIZATION
------------------

 The Visualization Manager is set in the main().
 The initialisation of the drawing is done via the command
 > /control/execute vis.mac
 	
 The detector has a default view which is a transversal view of the geometry.

 The tracks are drawn at the end of event, and erased at the end of run.
 Optionally the way of drawing the particles can be changed in the
 TBEVentActionMessenger class.  


 4. PHYSICS DEMO
 -----------------

 The particle's type and the physic processes which will be available
 in this example are set in FCALPhysicsList class.

 In addition a build-in interactive command (/process/inactivate proname)
 allows to activate/inactivate the processes one by one.

 The threshold for producing secondaries can be changed.
 eg: /run/particle/setCut 100 micrometer
     /run/initialize


 5. HOW TO START ?
 ----------------- 

 - compile and link to generate an executable
      % cd geant4/examples/advanced/lAr_calorimeter/lArcal 
      % gmake
 		
 - execute the program  in 'batch' mode from macro files
      % lArcal    prerunlAr.mac
 		
 - execute Test  in 'interactive mode' with visualization
      %  lArcal 
         ....
  
 Idle> type your commands
         ....
 	
  Idle> exit

6. HISTOGRAMS
--------------
 
 lArcal produces 4 histograms (saved as fcal.paw) which illustrate
 the final state of the most important variables of the example:

 Histo1 --> Number of tracks out of World
 Histo2 --> Number of secondary particles
 Histo3 --> Electromagnetic Energy deposit in the EMModule
 Histo4 --> Hadronic Energy deposit in the HadModule

 The example generates 3 ntuples too which contains the same information 
 than the histograms. 

 See their definitions in FCALRunAction.cc

 Note that histograms are disabled via the flag G4ANALYSIS_USE in GNUmakefile.


 7. Using the Anaphe implementation of the AIDA 3.0 histograms:
 ---------------------------------------------------------------

 In order to use the new Anaphe implementation of the AIDA 3.0 interfaces, 
 prepare some environment variables by source-ing one of the following 
 startup scripts.

 # This example has been developed and tested with the gcc-2.95.2 compiler:
                                                       ----------

 o Set up the environment variable: G4ANALYSIS_USE 
 o setenv PATH ${PATH}:/afs/cern.ch/sw/lhcxx/specific/redhat72/gcc-2.95.2/5.0.2/bin
                                                         |
                                                         |
                                             (Hier your system must be specified;
                                              if it is redhat61 or redhat73... this
                                              link has to be changed to the 
                                              corresponding system.)

  o source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lhcxx/share/LHCXX/5.0.2/install/sharedstart.csh or .sh
  o ln -s /afs/cern.ch/sw/lhcxx/share/LHCXX/5.0.2/scripts/* ~/bin/. 
    (This has to be made only one)
     
 After this, you will have access to the 'aida-config' command which
 is used in the GNUmakefile.
