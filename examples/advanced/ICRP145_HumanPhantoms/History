# Example ICRP145_HumanPhantoms History

See `CONTRIBUTING.rst` for details of **required** info/format for each entry,
which **must** added in reverse chronological order (newest at the top).
It must **not** be used as a substitute for writing good git commit messages!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2023-11-15 I. Hrivnacova, John Allison (ICRP145Phantoms-V11-01-03)
- Updated vis.mac and standalone.mac:
  - Changed "/vis/open XYZ [600x600-0+0]" to "/vis/open" to allow run-time choices
    and simplified comments.
  - Keep previous driver opening with an extra setting in commented lines

## 2023-04-08 Susanna Guatelli (ICRP145Phantoms-V11-01-02)
- Code revision in the TETRun class
  
## 2023-03-21 John Allison (ICRP145Phantoms-V11-01-01)
- standalone.mac: Disable auto refresh *before* creating scene.
  - For auto-refresh viewers, without this change the viewer attempts
    to draw the detector with the default view parameters, and in
    the case of this phantom, it overwhelms the graphics system.
  - This phantom should be displayed with special mesh rendering.

## 2023-03-19 John Allison (ICRP145Phantoms-V11-01-00)
- Introduce ICRP145standalone.
  - "make" builds two executables - ICRP145phantoms and ICRP145standalone.
  - ICRP145standalone allows you to visualise the phantom without the
    overhead of the run manager and physics tables and geometry
    initialisation. Of course, you cannot run or visualise trajectories.

## 2022-10-04 Gabriele Cosmo (ICRP145Phantoms-V11-00-03)
- Fixed compilation warnings on Intel-icx compiler for set but unused variable
  in TETModelImport source; code formatting.

- README file updated
- RunManagerFactory implemented
- QGSP_BIC_HP physics list adopted
- general code review
- Migration to c++11/14/17 features
    
## 2022-09-09 Susanna Guatelli (ICRP145Phantoms-V11-00-01)
- Ranecu Engine removed. Default one now used
    
## 2022-07-24 John Allison (ICRP145Phantoms-V11-00-00)

    https://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%20145.
