README file relative to proton experimental Bragg peaks


Description of experimental data file provided and of the 
corresponding simulation configuration to use for the comparison

--> experimental62MeVProtonBraggPeak.out
    This is a two columns file reresenting an experimental proton Bragg peak acquired
    at the INFN-LNS proton therapy facility and generated by a 62 MeV proton beam penetrating
    a water tank.
    The first column represent the depth in millimeters of water;
    The second column represent the energy deposited per millimeter as measured by an
    ionisation chamber moving in water.
