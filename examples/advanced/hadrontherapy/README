----> 0. INTRODUCTION.                                                    
                                                                       
The hadrontherapy example simulates an hadron-therapy beam line. 
In particular the example models the specific proton therapy beam line
installed at Laboratori Nazionali del Sud (INFN) in Catania, Sicily (Italy).

or/and proton/hadron therapy in general, please visit the

Moreover, since the Release of December 2008, with this example is also possible the 
simulation of carbon ion beams as the correct physic models are inserted with the
builted-in physic list denominated "QGSP_BIC".

---->1. GEOMETRY SET-UP.
 
The elements simulated are:

1. A scattering system, to spread geometrically the beam;

2. A system of collimators, to avoid the scattering radiation;

3. A modulation system that spreads the beam in energy and
   produces the so-called spread out bragg peak;
   It is constituted by a rotating wheel of different thichnesses.
   The wheel rotates around is axis (parallel to the proton
   beam axis) and its movement can be obtained by means of a 
   messenger between runs.

4. A set of monitor chambers (special transmission ionisation 
   chambers used to control hadron flux during the irradiation);

5. A "nozzle" and a final collimator defining the final shape
   of the beam before reaching the patient.

6. A water phantom: it is a box of water where the energy deposit is 
   calculated.
   The use of  the water phantom is required by the international protocol
   on the measure of dose in the case of proton and ion beams (IAEA 398, 2000).


-------> 2. PHYSICS

A particular care is addressed to the simulation of the physic processes.

Three differnt approaches can be used for the choose of the physic models.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
APPROACH 1:
>>>>>>>>>>

Using the macro command 

/physic/addPhysics/<physics List name>.

In this case the models (for electromagnetic, hadronic elastic and hadronic inelstic) can be 
activated directly calling the name of the Physics Lists that are available inside the 
Geant4 kernel in the directory:

$G4INSTALL/source/physics_lists/builders/include 

An example of the use of the Physics List can be found in the macro files:
proton_therapy.mac and ion_therapy.mac

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
APPROACH 2:
>>>>>>>>>>

A set of built-in physic models are also contained inside the Hadrontherapy directory. These
are called Local*.cc and Local*.hh and can be activated using the macro command:
/physic/addPhysics/<name>.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
APPROACH 3:
>>>>>>>>>>

We developed this approach in order to semplify the choice of the physic models to 
be used in the application.
**  With this approach the user must only insert a command line in his/her .mac file
    (using the /physics/addPackage PACKAGE_NAME).
    
This permits to switch-on an already build physic package.

** Various packages are already present in the Geant4 tree: they are in the directory:
   geant4/source/physics_lists/lists/include

** In this case hadronic inelastic models are directly activated for every particle.
*****************************************************************************************

------------------------------------------------------------------
SUGGESTED PHYSIC FOR ION BEAMS IN THE RANGE 0 - 400 MeV
------------------------------------------------------------------
Two macro files (proton_therapy.mac and ion_therapy.mac) can be used for proton and ion
simulations.

Also the QGSP_BIC package can be used if the *Approach 3* is preferred.


-------> INCL/ABLA physics lists

The application includes INCL/ABLA inelastic process setup for
deuteron, triton and alpha particles.

In order to start using generic ion support (up to Carbon) you must
first install an INCL/ABLA development version into your Geant4
setup. The code for this version can be found on GitHub
(github.com/kaitanie/incl).

------->2. EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP.      
                                      
The application simulates the proton therapy beam line
installed at Laboratori Nazionali del Sud.
The default beam line is a typical treatment line composed by several elements all
devoted to create the so-called "terapeutical beam", i.e. a beam ideal 
for a radiotherapeutic treatment.

   The main elements are:
** The COLLIMATORS: placed along the beam line to collimate the beam;

** The RANGE SHIFTERS: to decrease the energy of the primary proton beam 
   to a specific value;

** The MODULATOR WHEEL: to modulate the energy of the primary and monoenergetic
   beam in to a wide spectrum. The energy modulation is necessary to 
   homogeneusly irradiate a tumour volume that can extends in depth 
   up to 20 mm;

** The MONITOR CHAMBERS: very thin ionisation chamber that permit the 
   dose monitoring during the patient irradiation;

** The MOPI detector: microstrips, air free detector utilised for the check of the beam symmetry
   during the treatment

** The PATIENT COLLIMATOR: a brass, tumour-shaped collimator able to 
   confine the proton irradiation field in order to irradiate just the tumour mass
   in the trasverse direction;

The user has the possibility to vary, via messenger, almost all the geometrical 
characteristics of the beam line elements (i.e. their position along the beam line, 
their thickness, etc.). More details on the available user messengers can be 
found in the Hadronterapy Documentation: http://workgroup.lngs.infn.it/geant4lns/).

At the end of the beam line, a typical water phantom is reproduced.
A user-defined region of the phantom is divided (via the ROGeomtry class) in 
cubic and identical voxels. The voxels size can be varied. At the end of the simulation 
the energy deposited by primary protons, and secondaries in each voxel
is collected. This information is available as an .hbk file (if the 
G4ANALYSIS_USE variable is defined).  

The default sizes of the active voxelized region are 40x40x40 mm and actually the voxel configuration
is 200 x 1 x 1, which means 200 slices with 0.2 mm of thickness.Of course this default can be modified
in order to obtain, for example, a matrix of 80x80x80 cubic voxels each with a lateral dimension of 0.5 mm.

As concern the cut and stepMax values, the default configuration implies a cut value of 0.01 mm in the whole
 world (use the command /physic/setCuts 0.01 mm) and a stepMax of 0.01 mm just in the phantom 
(use the command /Step/waterPhantomStepMax 0.01 mm).
In any case it is strongly recommended to use a stepMax value not bigger 
than 5% of the dose slice thickness.

------->3. SET-UP 
                                                                        
- a standard Geant4 example GNUmakefile is provided                     

setup with:                                                             
compiler = gcc-3.4.6
G4SYSTEM = linux-g++                                                    

The following section reports the necessary environment variables 
necessary for the run of Hadrontherapy.                     

------->3.1  ENVIROMENT VARIABLES

 - G4SYSTEM = Linux-g++

 - G4INSTALL              points to the installation directory of GEANT4;

 - G4LIB                  point to the compiled libraries of GEANT4;

 - G4WORKDIR              points to the work directory;

 - CLHEP_BASE_DIR         points to the installation directory of CHLEP; 

 - G4LEVELGAMMADATA       points to the photoevaporation library;

 - G4NEUTRONHPDATA	  points to the neutron data files;
 
 - G4RADIOACTIVEDATA      points to the libraries for radio-active decay 
                          hadronic processes;

 - G4ABLADATA             points to the data files needed by the INCL/ABLA hadronic model;
 
 - G4LEDATA               points to the low energy electromagnetic libraries

 - LD_LIBRARY_PATH = $CLHEP_BASE_DIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

---->3.2  VISUALISATION

The user can visualise the experimental set-up with OpenGL, DAWN and vrml

---->4. HOW TO RUN THE EXAMPLE                                         

In interactive mode:
> $G4WORDIR/bin/Linux-g++/Hadrontherapy
The defaultMacro.mac is executed

The primary particle beam parameter are:
Radiation:                proton beam;
Energy distribution:      gaussian;
Mean energy:              62.0 MeV;
Energy spread:            400 keV;


The modulator wheel can be rotated via the messenger:

Idle>/modulator/angle/xx deg

To produce a Spread Out Bragg Peak using the modulator a macro
(modulatorMacro.mac) is provided. With this macro the modulator is 
rotated of 360 degree at 1 deg steps. In each run 1000 protons are
generated as primary particles. Obviously a bigger resolution can be obtained 
with smaller angles or increasing the protons number in each run.

Modulator wheel can be omitted setting its material air.

run $G4WORKDIR/bin/Linux-g++/Hadrontherapy visualisationMacro.mac
to visualise the experimental set-up with OpenGL

---->6. SIMULATION OUTPUT                                    

The output is an .hbk file and a .root files. The files are  produced 
if the variable G4ANALYSIS_USE is set to 1 and the analysis tool (AIDA
interface) correctly installed.
The file contains  histograms and n-tuples.
The histograms contain the Bragg curves: energy deposited 
versus the depth in water (in mm) for the primary beam as well as all the secondaries produced. 
The n-tuple contains the total 3D energy deposit in the phantom; the information
is energy deposit in each voxel with respect to the position of the voxel.

Setup for analysis: AIDA 3.2.1  

Users can download the analysis tools from:  
http://aida.freehep.org/

Note that the same information can be stored in different format, 
like .root or .xml using the same AIDA interface.
Output is also stored in ASCII .out file. The file contains four columns; the first four columns represent the voxel indexs (that univocally identify the voxel volume) while the last column represent the energy deposited in the given voxel.


------->6.1  ROOT ANALYSIS

The application also supports using ROOT (http://root.cern.ch) directly without using AIDA.
This feature can be enabled by setting environment variable G4ROOTANALYSIS_USE to 1 and
unsetting G4ANALYSIS_USE.
