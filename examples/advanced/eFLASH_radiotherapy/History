# Example eFLASH_radiotherapy History

See `CONTRIBUTING.rst` for details of **required** info/format for each entry,
which **must** added in reverse chronological order (newest at the top). It must **not**
be used as a substitute for writing good git commit messages!

## 2024-11-09 G. Milluzzo (eFLASH_radiotherapy-V11-02-02)
- Added a new geometry in DetectorConstruction:added an array of multiple small size silicon carbide detectors within the water phantom for dose distribution computation
- Added the sensitive detector class for the silicon carbide array
- Updated the macro files

## 2024-08-12 I. Hrivnacova (eFLASH_radiotherapy-V11-02-01)
- Removed unused includes of G4Accumulable[Manager].hh from FlashRunAction

## 2024-01-10 G. Milluzzo (eFLASH_radiotherapy-V11-02-00)
- Added the FlashPhysicsListMessenger class to change the physics lists by macro commands (opt3,opt4,penelope and livermore)

## 2023-11-15 I. Hrivnacova (eFLASH_radiotherapy-V11-01-02)
- Updated vis.mac:
  - Changed "/vis/open XYZ [600x600-0+0]" to "/vis/open" to allow run-time choices
    and simplified comments.

## 2023-11-10 A. Ribon (eFLASH_radiotherapy-V11-01-01)
- In all macro files, introduced the UI command
  '/process/had/rdm/thresholdForVeryLongDecayTime 1.0e+60 year'
  to allow all radioactive decays (including the very long ones).
  This is necessary since G4 11.2, being 1 year the default time
  threshold above which the decays are ignored.

## 2023-06-19 G. Milluzzo (eFLASH_radiotherapy-V11-01-00)
- Removed visualization in batch mode

## 2022-11-18 F. Romano (eFLASH_radiotherapy-V11-00-00)
- Added the new advanced example eFLASH_radiotherapy
