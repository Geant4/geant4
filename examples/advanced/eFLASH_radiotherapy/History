## 2023-11-15 I. Hrivnacova (eFLASH_radiotherapy-V11-01-02)
- Updated vis.mac:
  - Changed "/vis/open XYZ [600x600-0+0]" to "/vis/open" to allow run-time choices
    and simplified comments.

## 2023-11-10 A. Ribon (eFLASH_radiotherapy-V11-01-01)
- In all macro files, introduced the UI command
  '/process/had/rdm/thresholdForVeryLongDecayTime 1.0e+60 year'
  to allow all radioactive decays (including the very long ones).
  This is necessary since G4 11.2, being 1 year the default time
  threshold above which the decays are ignored.

## 2022-11-18 F. Romano (eFLASH_radiotherapy-V11-00-00)
