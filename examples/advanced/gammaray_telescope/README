GammaRayTel is an example of application of Geant4 in a space
envinronment. It simulates a typical telescope for gamma ray analysis;
the detector setup is composed by a tracker made with silicon planes,
subdivided in ladders and strips, a CsI calorimeter and an
anticoincidence system. In this version, the three detectors are made
sensitive but only the hits on the tracker strips are registered and relevant 
information (energy deposition, position etc) are dumped to an external
ASCII file for subsequent analysis. 

Relevant information from the simulation is processed in the GammarayTelAnalysis
class and saved, through the G4AnalysisManager interface, to Histograms and 
Tuples. 

  a) Macros for the visualization of geometry and tracks with 
     OpenGL, VRML and DAWN drivers 

  b) Implementation of messengers to change some parameters of 
     the detector geometry, the particle generator and the analysis 
     manager (if present) runtime

  c) Readout geometry mechanism to describe an high number of 
     subdivisions of the planes of the tracker (strips) without
     affecting in a relevant way the simulation performances

  d) Histogramming facilities are presently provided through the G4AnalysisManager class.

  e) User interfaces via Xmotif or normal terminal provided

  
1. Setting up the environment variables
---------------------------------------

 - Setup for storing ASCII data 

  If you want to store the output data in an ASCII file 'Tracks_x.dat'
  where x stays for the run number. You should specify the environment 
  variable:

  setenv G4STORE_DATA 1

 - Setup for Visualization 

  IMPORTANT: be sure that your Geant4 installation has been done 
  with the proper visualization drivers; for details please see the 
  file geant4/source/visualization/README. 

  To use the visualization drivers set the following variables in 
  your local environment: 

  setenv G4VIS_USE_OPENGLX      1  # OpenGL visualization
  setenv G4VIS_USE_DAWNFILE     1  # DAWN file
  setenv G4VIS_USE_VRMLFILE     1  # VRML file
  setenv G4VRMLFILE_VIEWER  vrmlview  # If installed

 - Setup for Xmotif user interface
  
   setenv G4UI_USE_XM  1    

 - Set up for analysis 

  To compile the GammaRayTel example with the analysis tools activated, 
  set the following variables 

  setenv G4ANALYSIS_USE               1 # Use the analysis tools

2. Sample run
-------------

 To run a sample simulation with gamma tracks interacting with 
 the detector in its standard configuration and without any
 visualization, execute the following command in the example main 
 directory:

 $G4WORKDIR/bin/$G4SYSTEM/GammaRayTel 

 It is possible also to run three different configuration defined in 
 macro1.mac, macro2.mac and macro3.mac for visualization (OpenGL, VRML 
 and DAWN respectively) with the following command

 $G4WORKDIR/bin/$G4SYSTEM/GammaRayTel macroX.mac

 where X can be 1, 2 or 3. Be sure to have the right environment (see
 the preceding section) and the proper visualization driver enabled in
 your local G4 installation (see geant4/source/visualization/README for
 more information).

	
3. Detector description
-----------------------

 The detector is defined in GammaRayTelDetectorConstruction.cc
 It is composed of a Payload with three main detectors, a Tracker (TKR), a
 Calorimeter (CAL) and an Anticoincidence system (ACD). 

 The standard configuration is made of a TKR of 15 Layers of 2 views made of
 4*4 Si single sided silicon detectors with Lead converter, and a CAL of 
 5 layers of CsI, each made of 2 views of 12 CsI bars orthogonally posed.
 4 lateral panels and a top layer of plastic scintillator (ACL and ACT) 
 complete the configuration.
 The Si detectors are composed of two silicon planes subdivided in strips
 aligned along the X axis in one plane and along the Y axis for the other.

 The following baseline configuration is adopted:
 
 GEOMETRICAL PARAMETER 			VALUE

 Converter thickness 			300 microns  
 Silicon Thickness 			400 microns
 Silicon Tile Size XY                   9   cm
 Silicon Pitch                          200.micrometer 
 Views Distance                         1.  mm
 CAL Bar Thickness  			1.5 cm
 ACD Thickness                          1.  cm

 It is possible to modify in some way this configuration using the 
 commands defined in GammaRayTelDetectorMessenger. 
 This feature is available in the UI throught the commands subtree 
 "/payload/" (see the help command in the UI for more information).

4. Physics processes
--------------------

 This example uses a modular physics list, with a sample of Hadronic processes 
 (see the web page http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/~hpw/GHAD/HomePage/ for more adeguate
 physics lists), the Standard or the LowEnergy Electromagnetic processes.

5. Particle Generator
---------------------

 The GammaRayTelParticleGenerationAction and its Messenger let the user define
 the incident flux of particles, from a specific direction or from an 
 isotropic background. In the first case particles are generated on a spherical 
 surface which diameter is perpendicular to the arrival direction. In the second
 case the arrival directions are isotropic.

 The user can define also between two spectral options:
 monochromatic or with a power-law dependence. The particle
 generator parameters are accessible throught the UI tree "/gun/" (use the
 UI help for more information). We are planning to include, in the next
 releases of this example, the General Particle Source module of G4.
 
6. Hit
------

 In this version the hits from the TKR the CAL and the ACD are generated. 
 Only the hit from the TRK are saved. Each TKR hit contains the following 
 information

  a) ID of the event (this is important for multiple events run)
  b) Energy deposition of the particle in the strip (keV)
  c) Number of the strip 
  d) Number of the plane
  e) Type of the plane (1=X  0=Y)
  f) Position of the hit (x,y,z) in the reference frame of the payload

 The hit information are saved on an ASCII file named Tracks_N.dat, where 
 N is the progressive ID number associated to the run. 

7. Analysis
----------------
 
Relevant information from the simulation is processed in the GammarayTelAnalysis
class and saved, through the G4AnalysisManager interface, to Histograms and 
Tuples. The output file is written in ROOT format, but one can easily switch to 
XML (or Hbook) by changing the appropriate #include in GammarayTelAnalysis.hh
No external software is required (apart from the hbook case, in which the CERNLIB 
must be installed and a FORTRAN compiler must be present)

 Keep in mind that the actual implementation of the analysis tools in GammaRayTel
 is of a pedagogical nature, so we kept it as simple as possible. 

 The actual analysis produces some histograms (see next section) and an ntuple. 
 Both the histograms and the ntuple are saved at the end of the run in the file 
 "gammaraytel.root". Please note that in a multiple run session, 
the last run always override the root file.

8. Histogramming
----------------

 The 1D histograms contain the energy deposition in the last X plane of 
 the TKR and the hits distribution along the X planes of the TKR 
 (note again that these histograms have been chosen more for pedagogical 
 motivation than for physical one).

 These histograms are filled and updated at every event and are initialized 
 with each new run; the scale of the histograms is automatically derived from 
 the detector geometry. 

 Throught a messenger it is possible to set some options with
 the UI subtree "/analysis/" (use the UI help for more info); 

 In this example we only show the use of very basic feature of this new 
 simulation/analysis framework.

9. Digi
--------

 For the TKR also the digits corresponding to the Hits are generated. 
 A digi is generated when the hit energy deposit is greater than a threshold 
 (in this example setted at 120 keV). 
 The TKR digi information are stored on the same file Tracks_N.dat and contain:

  a) ID of the event (this is important for multiple events run)
  b) Number of the strip 
  c) Number of the plane
  d) Type of the plane (1=X  0=Y)
