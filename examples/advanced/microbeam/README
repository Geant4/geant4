---->0. INTRODUCTION.                                                    
                                                                       
The microbeam example simulates the cellular irradiation beam line 
installed on the AIFIRA electrostatic accelerator facility located at 
CENBG, Bordeaux-Gradignan, France. For more information on this facility, 
please visit :

---->1. GEOMETRY SET-UP.
 
The elements simulated are:

1. A switching dipole magnet with fringing field, to deflect the 3 MeV alpha 
beam generated by the electrostatic accelerator into the microbeam line, 
oriented at 10 degrees from the main beam direction;

2. A circular collimator object, defining the incident beam size at the 
microbeam line entrance;

3. A quadrupole based magnetic symmetric focusing system allowing equal 
transverse demagnifications of 10. Fringe fields are calculated from Enge's 
model.

4. A dedicated cellular irradiation chamber setup;

5. A set of horizontal and vertical electrostatic deflecting plates which can 
be turned on or off to deflect the beam on target; 

6. A realistic human keratinocyte voxellized cell observed from confocal 
microscopy and taking into account realistic nucleus and cytoplasm chemical 
compositions.


---->2. EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP.      
                                 
The beam is defined at the microbeam line entrance through a collimator 
5 micrometer in diameter. The beam is then focused onto target using a 
quadruplet of quadrupoles in the so-called Dymnikov magnetic configuration. 
The beam is sent to the irradiation chamber where it travels through a 
isobutane gas detector for counting purpose before reaching the polypropylene 
culture foil of the target cell which is immersed in the growing medium and 
enclosed within a dish.  

A cell is placed on the polypropylene foil and is irradiated using the 
microbeam. The cell is represented through a 3D phantom (G4PVParameterization) 
obtained from confocal microscopy. In the provided example, the voxels sizes 
are : 359 nm (X) x 359 nm (Y) x 163 nm (Z)

The primary particle beam parameters are generated from experimental 
measurements performed on the AIFIRA facility. Incident particle used for 
cellular irradiation are 3 MeV alpha particles.

More details on the experimental setup and its simulation with Geant4 can

---->3 VISUALIZATION

The user can visualize the targeted cell thanks to the Qt interface.

---->4. HOW TO RUN THE EXAMPLE                                         
  
The code should be compiled with cmake.

Run the example from your build directory with:
./microbeam microbeam.mac

or in interactive mode:
./microbeam

The example works in MT mode.

---->5. PHYSICS

Livermore physics list is used by default.

---->6. SIMULATION OUTPUT AND RESULT ANALYZIS                                    

The output results consist in a microbeam.root file per thread, 
containing several ntuples:

* total deposited dose in the cell nucleus and in the cell 
cytoplasm by each incident alpha particle;

* average on the whole run of the dose deposited per 
Voxel per incident alpha particle;

* final stopping (x,y,z) position of the incident 
alpha particle within the irradiated medium (cell or culture medium);

* stopping power dE/dx of the incident 
alpha particle just before penetrating into the targeted cell;

* beam transverse position distribution (X and Y) 
just before penetrating into the targeted cell;

These results can be easily analyzed using for example the provided ROOT macro 
file plot.C; to do so :
* be sure to have ROOT installed on your machine
* be sure to be in the directory where the output ROOT files have been created
* do: root plot.C
* or under your ROOT session, type in : .X plot.C to execute the macro file
