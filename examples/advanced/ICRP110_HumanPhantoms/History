# Example ICRP110_HumanPhantoms History

See `CONTRIBUTING.rst` for details of **required** info/format for each entry,
which **must** added in reverse chronological order (newest at the top). It must **not**
be used as a substitute for writing good git commit messages!

## 2023-03-21 John Allison (ICRP110Phantoms-V11-01-01)
- standalone.mac: Disable auto refresh *before* creating scene.
  - For auto-refresh viewers, without this change the viewer attempts
    to draw the detector with the default view parameters, and in
    the case of this phantom, it overwhelms the graphics system.
  - This phantom should be displayed with special mesh rendering.

## 2023-01-10 John Allison (ICRP110Phantoms-V11-01-00)
- Introduce ICRP110standalone.
  - "make" builds two executables - ICRP110phantoms and ICRP110standalone.
  - ICRP110standalone allows you to visualise the phantom without the
    overhead of the run manager and initialising all the physics tables.
    Of course, you cannot run or visualise trajectories.

## 2022-06-02 Susanna Guatelli (ICRP110Phantoms-V11-00-01)
- Error reading the first voxels (in x=0, y=0) corrected
- Migration to features of C++11/14/17

## 2021-12-10 Ben Morgan (ICRP110Phantoms-V11-00-00)
- Change to new Markdown History format

             Removed unused ICRP110PhantomAnalysisManager.hh.

03.08.2021 - S. Guatelli; ICRP110Phantoms-V10-07-06
             Implementation of bone material has been revised.
             UserScorerWriter has been changed in order to fix system testing
             problem (division by zero). Conditional operator introduced.

01.08.2021 - V. Ivanchenko; ICRP110Phantoms-V10-07-05
             Fixed hash code

28.07.2021 - S. Guatelli; ICRP110Phantoms-V10-07-04
             OrganMasses.dat has been updated. The Dose is now calculated
             averaged over the entire mass of the organ, and not only in the voxels
             of the organ where there is edep recorded.

24.07.2021 - S. Guatelli; ICRP110Phantoms-V10-07-03
             General code cleaning
             
12.07.2021 - J. Allison; ICRP110Phantoms-V10-07-02
             Use /vis/viewer/set/specialMeshRendering
             Draw the full phantom
             ColourMap.dat: all materials (except air) are opaque

24.05.2021 - B. Morgan (ICRP110Phantoms-V10-07-01)
- Bump required CMake version range to 3.12...3.20, matching core Geant4

29.03.2021 - J. Allison; ICRP110Phantoms-V10-07-00

             Migration to G4RunManagerFactory

27.10.2020 - S. Guatelli; ICRP110Phantoms-V10-06-00
             New advanced example modelling ICRP110 phantom models
