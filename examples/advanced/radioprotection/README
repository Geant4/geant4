----> Introduction.                                                     
                                                                       
Radioprotection example models different detectors for microdosimetry in space applications. The example lets the user
choose between the models of a simplified diamond (1), a micro-diamond (2) and a silicon microdosimeter (3):

1) A semplified diamond microdosimeter is based on the detector developed by Prof. Anatoly Rosenfeld and his team at the Centre For Medical Radiation Physics, CMRP, University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia. The design of the device is documented in J. Davis, et al., "Characterisation of a novel diamond-based microdosimeter prototype 
for radioprotection applications in space environments",IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science, 
Vol. 59, pp. 3110-3116, 2012.

2) The microdiamond detector is based on the detectors developed by the Research Group of The University of Rome "Tor Vergata". The design and performances of the detector are documented in C. Verona et al., "Spectroscopic properties and radiation damage investigation of a diamond based Schottky diode for ion-beam therapy microdosimetry", Journal of Applied Physics, vol. 118, 2015, and in C. Verona et al., "Toward the use of single crystal diamond based detector for ion-beam therapy microdosimetry", Radiation Measurements, vol. 110, 2018.


3) The silicon microdosimeter is based on the detector, developed by the Centre For Medical Radiation physics,
University of Wollongong, documented in D. Bolst et al “Validation of Geant4 for silicon microdosimetry 
in heavy ion therapy”, 2020 Phys. Med. Biol. 65 045014.


All the microdosimeters are set in vacuum and it is possible to select among the avilable detectors 
via a macro command (/geometrySetup/selectDetector "..."), which is included in the "geometry.mac" macro.
This macro is, in turn, called in both the vis.mac and run.mac macro files.
An isotropic field of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) protons is incident on the device. 
The energy deposition is calculated in the sensitive detectors. 
 
In particular in this example it is shown how to:
- model a realistic isotropic field of GCRs by means of the General Particle Source   
- model a realistic detector in Geant4
- retrieve the information of secondary particles originated in the SV
- define the physics by means of a Geant4 Modular Physics List
- characterise the response of a realistic detector.
- save results in an analysis ROOT file using the Geant4 analysis component.               

The example can be executed in multithreading mode

------------------------------------------------------------------------
----> 1.Experimental set-up.                                            

The diamond microdosimeter is set in the center of the world. The world is a box with size 1 m, filled with vacuum.

Four SV structures are modelled, but only one has been made active (SV_phys1)

The primary radiation field is defined by means of the GeneralParticleSource in the file
primary.mac
                           
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
----> 2.SET-UP 
                                          
A standard Geant4 example CMakeLists.txt is provided.                   

Setup for analysis:
By default, the example has no analysis component. 

To compile and use the application with the analysis on, build the example with the following command:
cmake -DWITH_ANALYSIS_USE=ON -DGeant4_DIR=/path/to/Geant4_installation /path/to/radioprotection example                                                   
          
plot.C is provided to plot the results of the simulation, contained
in the radioprotection.root file. If the user intends to use this macro, ROOT must be installed 
(http://root.cern.ch/drupal/).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
----> 3.How to run the example.                                         

- Batch mode:
  ./radioprotection run.mac
                                                                       
- Interative mode:                                                      
  ./radioprotection
   vis.mac is the default macro, executed in interactive mode.         
                                                                         
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----> 4. Primary radiation Field

The radiation field is defined with the General Particle Source.
Look at the macro primary.mac .

NOTE: To maximise efficiency the field has been modelled with a limiting angle to reduce redundant events.
                                                                       
------------------------------------------------------------------------
----> 5. Simulation output                                               

**** SEQUENTIAL MODE
The output is radioprotection.root, containing 
  - an ntuple with the A, Z, and energy of the secondary particles originated in the diamond microdosimeters.                  
  - an ntuple withe the energy spectrum (in MeV) of primary particles.
  - an ntuple with the energy deposition per event(in keV)  in the SV.                                                          

**** MULTITHREAD mode
output files:
radioprotection.root_t0
..
..
radioprotection.root_t#

where # is the number of threads

type: source MergeFiles to merge the output of each thread in a single one

----> 6.Visualisation                                                     

a macro is provided ad example of visualisation:  vis.mac

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----> Future developments

1) The code will be refined and analysis improved
2) scripts for micorodosimetric spectra analysis will be implemented
3) Different models of detectors will be also included
