----> Introduction.                                                     
                                                                        |  
The ULTRA detector is a hybrid 2-component system consisting of:                                  
                                                                        |
                                                                        
1) an UV detection system - the UVscope                                 |
2) an array of scintillator detectors - the ETscope                      
                                                                        |
The UVscope detects Cherenkov light associated to cosmic ray showers    
when it is diffusively reflected on ground.                             |
The ETscope detects in coincidence the charged particles of the shower. 
                                                                        |
In the current version only the UVscope simulation is included          
------------------------------------------------------------------------|
----> Description                                                       
                                                                        |
The UVscope consists of a Fresnel lens and a PMT located in the focal   
plane, enclosed in a cylindrical aluminum housing. The lens is 457 mm   |
in diameter and is made of UV transmitting acrylic with 5.6 grooves     
per mm. The description of the geometry of the Fresnel lens makes use   |
of object parameterisation/replication capabilities.                     
                                                                        |
The primary vertex generator describes a plane circular source of UV 
(3eV, about 400 nm) optical photons.                                    |
Depending on the user selection (see below for the relevant environment 
variables) the source can be positioned such that the photons are fired |
to a reflecting surface or, by default, directly to the UVscope 
(no reflecting surface is present in this case).                        |
Reflection at the surface can be chosen to be specular or diffuse.
In both cases the normal to the surface makes an angle of 45 degrees    |
with the UVscope axis and the photons are emitted at an angle of 
90 degrees with the UVscope axis.                                       |
If none of these variables is set no reflecting surface is used 
and the photons source is positioned at the UVscope axis. 
                                                                        |
The definition of the relevant optical boundaries, parameters and       
processes is made.                                                      |
                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------|
----> SET-UP 
                                                                        |
A standard Geant4 example GNUmakefile and a CMakeLists.txt file are 
provided, for building with cmake                                       |

The following environment variables can be set:                         |

 1) GNUmakefile

  setenv ULTRA_VERBOSE
  setenv ULTRA_MIRROR_USE 1 : A specular reflecting surface is used.
  setenv ULTRA_GROUND_USE 1 : A diffusive reflecting surface is used. 

 2) CMakeLists.txt

    set ON/OFF the appropriate option (ULTRA_MIRROR_USE, ULTRA_GROUND_USE)


------------------------------------------------------------------------

The analysis is performed using the native Geant4 analysis tools 
(g4tools). In the default case, the output histograms are written 
as xml files.

The output file can be written in ROOT format by editing the file 
 include/UltraAnalysisManager.hh
to uncomment
 #include "g4root.hh"
and comment out
 #include "g4xml.hh"

The output can be get also in hbook format (but this will require a 
FORTRAN compiler) by following the istructions of Sect. 9.2 of 
the Geant4 application developer manual (Analysis Manager Classes)

----> How to run the example.                                           |

  From the directory where the Ultra binary resides :

  ./Ultra UltraMacro.mac   for running in batch mode                   |
                                                                       |                                             
  ./Ultra     for running in interative mode.                          |

------------------------------------------------------------------------
----> Simulation output                                                 |

the output is ultra.xml (or ultra.root) 		                            | 
 It contains:
 1)1Dhistogram with the detected photons energy (eV)                    |
 2)1Dhistogram with the number of detected photons per event            |

------------------------------------------------------------------------
----> Visualisation                                                     | 

a macro is provided as example of visulisation:  Visualisation.mac      | 
to run it :  $G4WORKDIR/bin/Linux-g++/Ultra Visualisation.mac
