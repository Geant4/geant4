06 Dec 2005 - radmon-V07-01-14 - R. Capra - Documentation extended README
                        file now covers all the aspects of the application
                        in great details. Small changes in RadmonApplication
                        and RadmonApplicationAnalysisSetup so that when
                        G4ANALYSIS_USE is not set, code builds without
                        analysis. RadmonPhysicsList changed in order to
                        manage particles changes present from tag
                        geant4-08-00-cand01. Stepping action added in order
                        to manage these changes. Errors present in
                        RadmonPhysicsHadronsBertini, RadmonPhysicsDecay,
                        RadmonPhysicsICRUIonization corrected. The error
                        present in RadmonPhysicsHadronsBertini caused the
                        application crash. The error present in
                        RadmonPhysicsDecay, RadmonPhysicsICRUIonization
                        caused a not true warning message appear.

                        - RadmonApplication has been splietted into classes
                          for management purposes and in order to improve
                          the compilation time and dependencies.
                        - Completely new generator package with a design
