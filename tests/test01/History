This file should be used by the test developer to briefly
summarize all major modifications introduced in the code and keep
track of all tags.

June 1, 2010  Gabriele Cosmo (test01-V09-03-00)
- Removed inclusion of obsolete G4MultipleScattering class, also not used
  in the physics-list of this test...
