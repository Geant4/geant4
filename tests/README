     =========================================================
     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
     =========================================================

                      System Tests module
                      -------------------

This module collects a set of "system" tests which are used as part of the
validation procedure, to verify and control the overall functionalities of
the GEANT4 toolkit.
The system tests must be considered as "global" regression tests aimed to
verify the robustness and reliability of the product in many areas.
Therefore, each test may include more than one test case, covering different
initial conditions and setups. Initial setups for a specific tests are
represented by *.in macros, reference outputs for each test case are
represented by *.out files.
This set of tests is going to be extended in future, to become more and more
exhaustive and complete.
