This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every

- consolidate updates for stl migration and new refence outputs

tests-V03-00-00  25th Jan 2001  Steve O'Neale 
- update reference outputs for the monthly reference tag
  There has been considerable work in the EM areas so almost
  every test has at the very least different values for the
  min.delta Energy in solids and   sometimes liquids and gases.
  For the tests printing tracking output there are completely 
  new values. I have the impression from browsing files with
  tkdiff that there are more energy-loss steps and there are
  a few cases where a physics process changes - a change from
  conv to brems changes the output log. 
  There are no identified changes from the geometry tags.
