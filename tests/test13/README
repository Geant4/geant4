                            Test13
                            ------

Description:    test of QGS string model with precompound model.
                100, 400 and 1000 GeV hadrons incident upon simple 
                box of air, aluminum or lead.

Type of test:   run to completion

Building:     This test has a special CMakeLists.txt to be used only by system
              testing.  It will not work when you run the test in stand-alone
              mode.  To do that you must:

              1. copy the test13 directory from geant4/tests to your working
                 directory

              2. replace the existing version of CMakeLists.txt with a
                 stand-alone one:

                 mv CMakeLists.txt CMakeLists.txtorig
                 mv CMakeLists_Standalone.txt CMakeLists.txt

              3. Clean up (if necessary) and re-configure, assuming a 64 bit machine
                 and Geant4 version 9.6:

                 cmake . 

              4. Build both test13 and test13_hadronic_exerciser:

                 make -f Makefile 
 
Running:      First generate the input file:

                 ./test13_hadronic_exerciser large_N >& test13.largeN.in &

              which sets the number of events per run to 2000.  Without the 
              large_N argument there will be 100 events per run.

              Finally, run the test:
  
                 ./test13 test13.largeN.in >& test13.out &
 
Output:       run log
