NOTE: this is a draft, still work-in-progress !!! 

Intermediate energy validation is done by comparing Monte Carlo predictions 
vs experimental data. The data come from 2 experiments:
 (1) ITEP data on inclusive proton/neutron production in pi+/pi-/p induced
     processes with a number of nuclei for beam momenta between 1 and 9 GeV/c,
     Yu.D.Bayukov et al, Preprint ITEP-148-1983, Sov.J.Nucl.Phys. 42, 116;
 (2) BNL data on inclusive pion/kaon/proton production in proton-nuclei
     collision at 14.6 GeV/c, T. Abbott et al, Phys.Rev. D45, 3906

The ITEP experiment measures Lorentz invariant cross section as a function
of kinetic energy of the final state particle at certain fixed angles. The
BNL experiment measures Lorentz invariant cross section as a function of
reduced transverse mass in fixed rapidity bins. Accordingly the test is
made of 2 parts:

I. Comparison of Geant4 predictions with experimentally measured inclusive 
   distributions for protons and neutrons in the following reactions 
   (ITEP test):
   0) pi+ C at 1.4 GeV/c   4) pi- C  at 5.0 GeV/c   8) p C at 1.4 GeV/c
   1) pi+ U at 1.4 GeV/c   5) pi- Cu at 5.0 GeV/c   9) p U at 1.4 GeV/c
   2) pi+ C at 5.0 GeV/c   6) pi- Pb at 5.0 GeV/c  10) p C at 7.5 GeV/c
   3) pi+ U at 5.0 GeV/c   7) pi- U  at 5.0 GeV/c  11) p U at 7.5 GeV/c


II. Comparison of Geant4 predictions and experimentally measured inclusive 
    distributions for pi+/-, K+/-, or protons in the following reactions 
    (BNL test):
    12) p Be at 14.6 GeV/c
    13) p Cu at 14.6 GeV/c
    14) p Au at 14.6 GeV/c

Data are stored in SVN (in the past, in CVS), together with the C++ code of 
the package, in a form of ASCII tables, under /itep or /bnl subdirectories.

The following Geant4 modelsb are: Bertini, Binary, FTFP(reco).
Note that CHIPS model has been discontinued, and with that we've also removed
QGSC and FTFC tests.
LEP model is currently depricated, and is not in tests either.
Bertini is tested at all of the above energies.
FTFP is NOT used at 1.4GeV as this energy is outside of the model validity range.
Binary is not used at 5.0GeV or 7.5GeV, as the model isn't really applicable there
(it runs but the results are poor).

Monte Carlo predictions are obtained by running Geant4-based application, that 
can be configured at run time, to simulate a given number of events (1,000,000 
in this case) for a given beam-target combination at a given energy, and to 
employ one or another Geant4 hadronic model, or to execute sequentially 
several hadronic models.

Example input/configuration applications are provided as part of the package:

    test47pip.itep, test47pim.itep, test47p.itep, and test47.bnl.

These job input files exemplify how this Geant4-based executable can be 
configured to simulate 
  user-specified number of interactions (card #events)
  a beam particle  (card #particle) 
  a given momentum (card #momentum) in MeV/c 
  a target         (card #material),
  a given Geant4 hadronic model (card #generator), 
A sequence of Geant4 hadronic models can be provided in a single job. 
If several beam-target-model combo's are requested in a single job 
configuration file, the job will loop over them; card #run will trigger the 
execution of a beam-target-model combo, for the given number of events.
Card #exit will terminate the job.

(NOTE: in principal, job configuration language allows to run also more than
one combination of beam-target, but such job may be very CPU-heavy, and we do
not recommend it).  

The output of a job will be one or several ROOT files (histograms). Each ROOT 
file will correspond to a given combination of beam-target-energy and a given 
Geant4 hadronic model.  

To analyze the output and to compare predictions of different Geant4 hadronic 
models (vs experimental data, or vs each other) several ROOT scripts are
provided, via PlotITEPAnalysis.C, Plot.C, and PlotMIPS.C; they also stored in 
SVN as a part of the package.


Creation of the executable:
---------------------------

The makefile in the directory will create the executable in the bin area.
However one need to setup the environment for Geant4 as well as ROOT. It 
is important to setup the compiler to the same one by which the Geant4 
and ROOT library are created. 

For usage in the cmslpc cluster and using Geant4 and ROOT libraries already
created for CMS application, a directory "misc" is created which provides
"g4setup.csh" for defining the environment variable. One need to comment and
uncomment a few lines in GNUmakefile to create the executable. 

Additional information:
----------------------

Together with the Geant4 application code and the data tables shell run 
scripts are provided that allow to execute these tests, either interactively, 
in batch, or in a grid-like environment.

As part of the work flow, each run script will automatically generate necessary
job configuration input files (and will clean it/them after job completion). 
Each shell script executes not only the Geant4 run, but also analysis step, 
and delivers comparison plots in the encapsulated postscript format (eps).

-- run_pip_itep.csh will execute either all 4 tests 0)-3), or if given an input
   argument from 0 through 3, it'll execute a given test

-- run_pim_itep.csh will execute either all 4 tests 4)-7), or if given an input
   argument, will execute selected

-- run_proton_itep.csh will execute all 4 tests 8)-11), or if given an input 
   argument, will run selected 

-- run_bnl.csh will execute all 3 12)-14), of if given an input argument, will
   run selected
 
-- run_itep.csh will submit to batch 12 jobs that compose ITEP test; if a user
   prefers to submit a selected subset of jobs of the ITEP test, she/he can use
   2 input arguments: the 1st one will specify the number of jobs 
   (max/default=12), and the 2nd one will specify at where to start (default=0)
   
-- run_all.csh will submit to batch 15 jobs, i.e. the 12 jobs of the ITEP 
   tests, and the 3 jobs of the BNL test
