                            Test12
                            ------

Description:    test of FTF string model with 
		  - precompound model (default)
		  - or Binary Cascade
		via choosing the Physics list, use second argument, possible values
		are FTFP and FTF_BIC. 
                100 GeV hadrons incident upon simple box of air, 
                aluminum or lead.

Type of test:   run to completion

Building:       This test has a special CMakeLists.txt to be used only by system
                testing.  It will not work when you run the test in stand-alone
                mode.  To do that you must:

                1. copy the test directory from geant4/tests to your working
                   directory

                2. replace the existing version of CMakeLists.txt with a
                   stand-alone one:

                   mv CMakeLists.txt CMakeLists.txtorig
                   mv CMakeLists_Standalone.txt CMakeLists.txt

                3. Clean up (if necessary) and re-configure, assuming a 64 bit machine
                   and Geant4 version 9.6:

                   rm test12
                   rm test12_hadronic_exerciser
                   cmake . 

                4. Build both test12 and test12_hadronic_exerciser:

                   make -f Makefile 
  

Running:        First generate the input file:

                   ./test12_hadronic_exerciser large_N >& test12.largeN.in &

                With the large_N argument, 2000 events per run are thrown.  Without it,
                100 events per run are thrown.

                Finally, run the test:
  
                   ./test12 test12.largeN.in >& test12.out &
 
Output:         run log
