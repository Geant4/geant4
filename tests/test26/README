                            Test26
                            ------
     This test is intended to test cut-per-region approach.
	
 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
     The geometry consists of the vertex detector (VD), the electromagnetic
     calorimeter (EM), and the muon identifier (MU). Detector layout along
     the axis Z.
  
     VD consisted of 3 layers of Si with pads structure along the axis X.
     Between VD and EM there are 2 active absorbers (scintillators). 
     EM is the matrix 5x5 of heavy crystals. MU consist of 2 active absorbers 
     (scintillators) and the iron plate between.

     2 additional to the World regions are defined: VertexDetector and 
     MuonDetector. For testing purposes first absorber of MU is included in 
     the region of VD.
   
     Material of calorimiter and absorber can be choosen: 
          Air Water lAr Al Fe BGO PbWO4 Pb.
     eg: /testem/det/CalMat PbWO4
         /testem/det/AbsMat Al
      
     The size of the detector can be changed also.
   
     eg: /testem/det/EcalLength   20  cm  
         /testem/det/EcalWidth     5  cm
         /testem/det/update             ---> rebuild the geometry
           
 2- PHYSICS LISTS

    Physics Lists are subdivided on 4 following modules:
    1. "particles" - particle definitions  
    2. "general" - decays and transportation  
    3. "standard" (alternative) - standard EM physics
    4. "model"    (alternative) - standard EM physics using model approach
      	    
 3- AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
     The primary kinematic consists of a single particle which hits the
     cylinder perpendicular to the input face. The type of the particle
     and its energy are set in the PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can
     changed via the G4 build-in commands of ParticleGun class.
 	 	
 7- OUTPUT
 
     As a result of simulation the number of secondaries produced
     in different regions are averaged. The average energy depositions 
     in active absorbers and EM as well as RMS of these values are shown.
     The number of hits in pads of VD is printed out.
