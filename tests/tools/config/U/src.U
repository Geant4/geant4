?X: Now check whether we have found the right source tree (i.e. the one for the
?X: package we're abount to configure). The original unit from Tom Tromey forced
?X: the user to pick a unique file from his distribution, and we were merely
?X: checking the existence of that file. I prefer to rely on Configure (which
?X: we know *is* present since this unit is part of it!) and look for the
?X: definition of the package variable, making sure it's the same as ours.
?X: If it matches, we know we found the right source tree. -- RAM, 15/03/96
