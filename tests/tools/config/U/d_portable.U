I can set things up so that your shell scripts and binaries are more portable,
at what may be a noticable cost in performance.  In particular, if you
ask to be portable, the following happens:

     1) Shell scripts will rely on the PATH variable rather than using
	the paths derived above.
     2) ~username interpretations will be done at run time rather than
	by Configure.
@if PHOSTNAME
     3) The system name will be determined at run time, if at all possible.
@end
