?S:	This variable contains the full pathname of the shell used

?S:	/bin/pdksh, /bin/ash, /bin/bash, or even something such as
?S:	D:/bin/sh.exe.
?S:	This unit comes before Options.U, so you can't set sh with a -D
?S:	option, though you can override this (and startsh)
?S:	with -O -Dsh=/bin/whatever -Dstartsh=whatever
