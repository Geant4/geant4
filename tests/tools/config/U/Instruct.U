This installation shell script will examine your system and ask you questions
to determine how the Geant4 Toolkit should be installed.  If you get stuck on
a question, you may use a ! shell escape to start a subshell or execute a
command.  Many of the questions will have default answers in square brackets;
typing carriage return will set the default.

On AFS it is allowed to specify either absolute or relative
paths (i.e. starting with the ~username construct).

EOH
	rp=''
	dflt='Type carriage return to continue'
	. ./myread
	cat <<'EOH'

The prompt used in this script allows you to use shell variables and backticks
in your answers. You may use $1, $2, etc...  to refer to the words in the
default answer, as if the default line was a set of arguments given to a
script shell. This means you may also use $* to repeat the whole default line.

Everytime there is a substitution, you will have to confirm.  If there is an
error (e.g. an unmatched backtick), the default answer will remain unchanged
and you will be prompted again.

Running 'Configure -d' will bypass nearly all the questions and
use the computed defaults (or answers saved in a configuration
previously generated).

Type 'Configure -h' for a list of options.

You may also start interactively and then answer '& -d' at any prompt to turn
on the non-interactive behaviour for the rest of the execution.

EOH
	. ./myread
	cat <<EOH

Much effort has been spent to ensure that this shell script will run on any
Unix system. If despite that you can't run Configure for some reason, you'll
have to set the proper environment variables by hand and follow the "manual"
installation as specified in the Geant4 Installation Guide.
