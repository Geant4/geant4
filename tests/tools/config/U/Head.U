# (If you are trying to port this package to a machine without sh,
# I would suggest you have a look at the prototypical config_h.SH file
# and edit it to reflect your system. Some packages may include samples
# of config.h for certain machines, so you might look for one of those.)

# Yes, you may rip this off to use in other distribution packages. This

# (Note: this Configure script was generated automatically. Rather than
# working with this copy of Configure, you may wish to get metaconfig.
# The dist-3.0 package (which contains metaconfig) was posted in
# comp.sources.misc and is available on CPAN under authors/id/RAM so
# you may fetch it yourself from your nearest archive site.)
#
?X:
?X: NOTA BENE:
?X: If you develop you own version of metaconfig based on this work,
?X: you have to add some comments telling that the script was generated
?X: by your version, not mine: It credits your work.

?X:
?X: There are two schools of thoughts here. Some people correctly argue that
?X: the user has a better chance than we do of setting a reasonable PATH and
?X: others argue that Configure is the best place there is to set up a suitable
?X: PATH. Well, here we try to compromize by keeping the user's PATH and
?X: appending some directories which are known to work on some machine or the
?X: other. The rationale behind this being that a novice user might not have a
?X: proper environment variable set, and some directories like /etc (where
?X: chown is located on some BSD systems) may be missing--RAM.
?X:
?X: SVR4 adds an /opt directory for optional packages.  Some sites use
?X: various permutations on /opt as opposed to /usr or /usr/local.-- ADO
?X:
?X: We only add directories that are not already in the PATH of the
?X: user and the directories must exist also.
