?X: 
?X: This unit produces a bit of shell code that must be dotted in in order
?X: to get a file name and make some sanity checks. Optionally, a ~name
?X: expansion is performed.
?X:	
?X: To use this unit, $rp and $dflt must hold the question and the
?X: default answer, which will be passed as-is to the myread script.
?X: The $fn variable must hold the file type (f or d, for file/directory).
?X:
?X: If is is followed by a ~, then ~name substitution will occur. Upon return,
?X: $ans is set with the filename value. If a / is specified, then only a full
?X: path name is accepted (but ~ substitution occurs before, if needed). The
?X: expanded path name is returned in that case.
?X:
?X: If a + is specified, the existence checks are skipped. This usually means
?X: the file/directory is under the full control of the program.
?X:
?X: If the 'n' (none) type is used, then the user may answer none.
?X: The 'e' (expand) switch may be used to bypass d_portable, expanding ~name.
?X:
?X: If the 'l' (locate) type is used, then it must end with a ':' and then a
?X:	file name. If the answer is a directory, the file name will be appended
?X: before testing for file existence. This is useful in locate-style
?X: questions like "where is the active file?". In that case, one should
?X: use:
?X:
?X:   dflt='~news/lib'
?X:   fn='l~:active'
?X:   rp='Where is the active file?'
?X:   . ./getfile
?X:   active="$ans"
?X: 
?X: If the 'p' (path) letter is specified along with 'l', then an answer
?X: without a leading / will be expected to be found in everyone's path.
?X:
?X: It is also possible to include a comma-separated list of items within
?X: parentheses to specify which items should be accepted as-is with no
?X: further checks. This is useful when for instance a full path is expected
?X: but the user may escape out via "magical" answers.
?X:
?X: If the answer to the question is 'none', then the existence checks are
?X:	skipped and the empty string is returned.
