?X: This unit produces a shell script "loc" which can be used to find out
?X: where in a list of directories something is.  It then uses loc to
?X: determine the location of commonly used programs.  It leaves loc sitting
?X: around for other Configure units to use, but arranges for its demise
?X: at the end of Configure.
?X: 
?X: To add a new program to find, add it both to the ?MAKE: line and to either
?X: the loclist or trylist variable.
?X: 
?X: I put startsh at the end of the dependency list, in order to avoid the
?X: loading of the spitshell unit before the instructions.

They are not compatible!  You are probably running ksh on a non-USG system.
I'll have to use $echo instead of the builtin, since Bourne shell doesn't
have echo built in and we may have to run some Bourne shell scripts.  That
means I'll have to use '$n$c' to suppress newlines now.
