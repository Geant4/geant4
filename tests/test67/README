                            test67
                            -------
  
 This test implements the Monte Carlo intercomparison exercise 
 described in 
  T. Vidmar et al., Appl. Rad. Iso. 66 (2008) 764-766
 The program calculates the full-peak efficiency of a Germanium 
 detector for different incident gamma radiation. The geometry is 
 simplified but anyway is a realistic description of a real-life 
 germanium detector for gamma spectroscopy. The purpose 
 is to compare results obtained with different EM models of Geant4 
 with those from the reference paper and to quantify changes 
 in EM models at each Geant4 release. 
	
 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
  Two different configurations have been implemented, that are labeled 
  as "geometry2" and "geometry3" in the original paper. Geometry can be 
  switched at run-time via the command
   /testem/geometry/geometryType 2
   /testem/geometry/geometryType 3

  The two geometries have the same detector and differ for the source 
  configuration.
  The Germanium crystal (rho=5.323 g/cm3) is a cylinder with radius 30 mm 
  and height 60 mm. The crystal has a 1 mm top dead layer and 1 mm side dead 
  layer. The central borehole is 40 mm in length and 10 mm in diameter, drilled 
  on the bottom side of the crystal. The crystal is encased in an aluminum 
  housing (density: 2.7 g/cm3) with thickness 1 mm and dimensions 70mm diameter 
  and 70 mm height. The distance between the crystal and the housing is 4 mm on 
  all sides. The space around the housing if free of any substance (vacuum)
	
  In the geometry #2 the source is a point-like source located 5 mm above 
  the Al housing and on the crystal symmetry axis.
  In the geometry #3 the point source is replaced by an extended source in 
  the form of a water cylinder with an artificial density of 3.0 g/cm3, a 
  diameter of 90 mm and a thickness of 40 mm. The closest distance between 
  the extended source and the detector housing is 5 mm. The extended source 
  has no container.

	    
 2- PHYSICS LISTS
 
    The global physics list used in the test contains: Electromagnetic 
    Physics and Decay physics. 
    Decay physics is from the G4 kernel G4DecayPhysics().

    The builders for the EM part can be local (eg. in this example) or 
    from G4 kernel physics_list/ subdirectory.
         
    From geant4/source/physics_lists/builders:	 
    - "emstandard"      recommended standard EM physics for LHC
    - "emstandard_opt1" best CPU performance standard physics for LHC
    - "emstandard_opt2"     
    - "emstandard_opt3" 
    - "emlivermore" 
    - "empenelope" (Penelope physics, v2008)
    - "penelope08" (alias of "empenelope") 
    
    Local physics builders:	 
    - "penelope01"      low-energy EM physics with Penelope01 models
			(obsolete, will be deleted in the future)
    - "penelopelocal"   same Penelope v2008 models as "empenelope",
	                but implemented as a local physics list
	
    Physics lists and options can be (re)set with UI commands. The 
    
    The default cut which is used for all particles is 0.01 mm.
        	    
 3- AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
  The primary kinematic consists of a single particle with isotropic angular 
  distribution. The default primary is a gamma ray, but it can be changed 
  interactively via the UI commands 
   /gun/particle
  The primary energy can be also changed interactively 
   /gun/energy
  the default being 1 MeV.

  The starting position of the primary particle depends on the geometry 
  configuration (geometry#2 and #3, as listed in Sect. 1). For geometry #2, 
  a point-like source is considered in the appropriate position. For 
  geometry #3 the position is sampled uniformly over the extended source 
  volume. In all cases, the angular distribution is isotropic, to simulate 
  a typical gamma-ray emission in a radioactive decay.
 	
  A RUN is a set of events.
  
  test67 computes the energy deposited in the active Ge volume and produces 
  and energy spectrum. It also calculates, for each run, the fraction of 
  events in which the deposited energy is equal (within 0.1%) to the full 
  primary energy. This corresponds to the detector efficiency vs. energy 
  which is quoted in the benchmark paper
	T. Vidmar et al., Appl. Rad. Iso. 66 (2008) 764-766
 	
  The output is written in a text file, which 
  contains (one line per each run): 
   energy (keV)
   fraction of full-energy events (= detector efficiency)
   statistical uncertainity on the detector efficiency
			
  The file in named after the geant4 version (taken from 
  G4Version) and the name of the EM builders which is being 
  used. For example, geant4-09-04-ref-01_empenelope.dat.

 4- VISUALIZATION
 
  The Visualization Manager is set in the main().
  The initialisation of the drawing is done via the commands :
  /vis/... in the macro vis.mac. In interactive session:
  Idle > /control/execute vis.mac
  Notice that visualization is not available in batch mode 
  (namely, it is not possible to run as 
    % test67 vis.mac 	
  because the G4VisExecutive is not instantiated).

  The default view is a geometry#3
 	 	 	
 5- HOW TO START ?
 
  - compile and link to generate an executable
 	% cd test67
 	% gmake
 		
  - execute test67 in 'batch' mode from macro files
 	% test67 test67.in
 		
  - execute test67 in 'interactive mode' with visualization
 	% test67
 	....
 	Idle> type your commands. For instance:
        Idle> /control/execute vis.mac
 	Idle> /control/execute test67.in
 	....
 	Idle> exit
 	
 6- HISTOGRAMS
test67 can produce histograms and output in ROOT format. In order to use the ROOT 
facilities, the environment variable ROOTSYS must be set. If it is not set, only 
an ASCII file with the run summary (full peak efficiency) will be created, as 
described in Sect. 3.

The ROOT file has a name given by the Geant4 version used for the run and the EM 
physics which was chosen, e.g. geant4-09-04-ref-00_empenelope.root. The file contains:
- one histogram (TH1D) per each run. The histogram has upper limit equal to the full 
energy of the incoming primary particle (+ 10 keV for tolerance) and 0.5 keV/bin. 
Energy scales are always in keV.
- two TObjString objects storing the G4Version which was used for the run and the choice 
of EM physics, respectively
- two TGraphErrors object with the peak efficiency profile vs. energy and the 
total efficiency profile vs. energy, respectively. One point per run is provided. 
- a TTree. The Branches of the Tree are: primary energy (keV), peak efficiency (in %) 
with the corresponding error, full efficiency (in %) with the corresponding 
uncertainty, average number of fluorescence gammas generate by photo-electric effect, 
e+/e- ionisation and Compton scattering (normalized per primary event). One entry 
per run is provided.
