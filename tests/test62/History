18th March 2010  Pekka Kaitaniemi (test62-V09-03-00)
- Migration to the new G4[e|Mu|h]MultipleScattering system

7th November 2008  Pekka Kaitaniemi (test62-V09-01-00)
- Use test24 as the basis of a new INCL/ABLA cascade/evaporation system test
- Modifications:
  o Use G4InclAblaCascadeInterface (INCL/ABLA for proton, neutron, pi+, pi-,
  pi0 projectiles)
  o Add Carbon, Lead and Thorium target material definitions
  o Hydrogen target not used in the run macro (H target not supported by INCL)
  o Set the test run energy to 1 GeV (INCL4.2 supports energies 200 MeV - 3
  GeV)

6th December 2005  Gabriele Cosmo
- Trivial changes for support of CLHEP-2.0.X series.

16th March 2004  Gabriele Cosmo
- Fixed compilation warnings.
- Replaced usage of NULL with 0.
