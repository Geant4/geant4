                 Test for importance sampling and scoring
                 ========================================

Remarks for system testing:
==========================

There are two macro files:
- MassGeo_TimedApp.mac, and 
- ParallelGeo_TimedApp.mac
as input for testing the executable: test33.
Please run the executable once for each macro file.


Very short note on what test33 does:
=====================================
Importance sampling and scoring (and weight roulette) is tested
using neutrons of 10 MeV bombarding a 180*cm high concrete cylinder.

Several modes of running are possible:
- fixed adjustments that may not be changed once they are set:
  - "geometry"
    - use the mass geometry
    - use the parallel geometry
  - "application"
    - timed: run for a certain amount of time and produce a FOM*time
    - visualise: use run for a certain number of events and display tracks
- adjustments changeable on-line
  - importance sampling
  - scoring
  - weight roulette


The executable may be invoked with or without a macro file:
- without macro file:
  use on-line commands to setup the application. Commands may be found in 
  the scripts below.
- with script:
  four main scripts exist:
  - MassGeo_TimedApp.mac: uses the mass geometry and a timed application
  - MassGeo_VisApp.mac: uses mass geometry and visualisation
  - ParallelGeo_TimedApp.mac: uses the parallel geometry and a timed 
    application
  - ParallelGeo_VisApp.mac: uses the parallel geometry and visualisation
  a script used in all four cases:
  - SamplingChange.mac: create several sampling configurations with to
    test importance sampling, scoring, (weight roulette) and changing
    between those configurations
- the script vis.mac is used when running in visualisation mode.
