This file should be used by the test developer to briefly
summarize all major modifications introduced in the code and keep
track of all tags.

November 16th, 2011 G.Folger - test33-V09-04-00
- Migrated to new G4Exception

March 25th, 2010 G.Cosmo - test33-V09-03-00
- Migrated physics list to use particle-based multiple-scattering processes.

April 21st, 2008 A.Howard - test33-V09-01-00
  - Fixed implementation of parallel geometry (previously it was over-laid with
    the mass world, hence not parallel at all, just grossly over-lapping).
  - Increased importance sampling geometry to be coincident with world volume -
    this removes the warning from the process as the weight doesn't change
  - Removed scaling factors (see Dec 15th, 2005 below)
  - Added MassGeo_TimedApp_new.out and ParallelGeo_TimedApp_new.out for output
    comparison purposes
  - CoupledTransportation can be forced to be used with the MassGeometry:
    MassGeo_TimedApp_coupled.mac (and output is MassGeo_TimedApp_coupled.out)
  - co-working with procbiasing-V09-01-01

Jun 25th, 2007 A.Howard - test33-V08-03-02
  - Added missing sstream header in Tst33SlobedConcreteShield.cc

Jun 22nd, 2007 A.Howard - test33-V08-03-01
  - Migrated to new scoring biasing scheme

Jun 22nd, 2007 A.Howard - test33-V08-03-00
  - Changed class names in Tst33AppStart.hh to be compatible with old
    biasing/transportation/scoring scheme

Nov 22nd, 2006 G.Cosmo - test33-V08-01-00
  - Removed obsolete vis-manager classes. Now using G4VisExecutive.

Dec 15th, 2005 A.Howard
  - Introduced scaling factor to increase physical volume and suppress 
    warnings due to importance sampling from particles crossing world volume.
    Currently set to x2.

Dec 6th, 2005 G.Cosmo
  - Trivial changes for support of CLHEP-2.0.X series.

Nov 15th, 2005 G.Cosmo - test33-V07-01-00
  - Migration to <sstream> from deprecated <strstream>.

Jun 6th, 2005 G.Cosmo - test33-V07-00-00
  - Fixed trivial compilation error on gcc-3.4.X (double semicolon).

Dec 8th, 2004 G.Cosmo
  - Implemented migration to <cmath>.

Oct 29th, 2004 H.Kurashige - test33-V06-02-00
  - Migrated processes to new G4VParticleChange interface.

Nov 25th, 2003 G.Cosmo - test33-V05-02-04
  - Fixes for compilation on WIN32-VC (Visual-C++ 6.0).

Nov 18th, 2003 G.Cosmo - test33-V05-02-03
  - Fixed usage of timer to allow porting on Windows. Use G4Timer instead
    of native system timer.

Nov 13th, 2003 J.Allison
  - Removed OPACS from Vis Manager.

Sep 16th, 2003 M.Dressel - test33-V05-02-02
  - using <strstream> instead of  <sstream> 
    cure some wornings

Aug 22th, 2003 M.Dressel - test33-V05-02-01
  - test for weight window technique

Aug 19th, 2003 M.Dressel - test33-V05-02-00
  - test for weight window technique

Apr  9th, 2003 M.Dressel - test33-V05-00-03
  - use geometries with a deeper structure to test the parallel
    transport and the G4IStore in a more challenging way

Mar 12, 2003 J.Allison - test33-V05-00-02
  - Added HepRep to vis manager.

Mar 11th, 2003 M.Dressel - test33-V05-00-01
  - change the replicanumber of the world volume from -1 to 0

Feb 19th, 2003 G.Cosmo - test33-V05-00-00
  - Removed redundant inclusion of PhysicalConstants.h.
    Now using CLHEP headers.

Dec 06th, 2002 G.Cosmo - test33-V04-01-05
  - Merged changes in messenger for migration to new G4ApplicationState.
  - Corrected GNUmakefile.

Nov 29th, 2002 M.Dressel - test33-V04-01-04
  - remove src/G4Trajectory.cc and added a DrawTrajectory function
    in Tst33VisEventAction
  - some changes dut to gcc-3.2 complains.

Nov 25th, 2002 M.Dressel - test33-V04-01-03
  - added src/G4Trajectory.cc.

Nov 23th, 2002 M.Dressel 
  - change of parallel geometry 

Nov 22th, 2002 M.Dressel 
  - changed geometry for scoring. Cells must not coinside with
    wolrd boundary since tracks would be killed before
    scoring is called in the case a track exits a cell into
    "out of world".

Nov, 20th 2002 M.Dressel - test33-V04-01-02
  - some code cleanup
  - added some comments to the header files
  - removed some old files

Nov, 4th 2002 M.Dressel - test33-V04-01-01
  - remove G4std:: where it does not belong to
  - replace str() functions

Oct 29, 2002 M.Dressel - test33-V04-01-00
  - first implementation

Oct 29, 2002 M.Dressel
  - first implementation

Oct 29, 2002 M.Dressel
  - added DISCLAIMERs

Oct 25, 2002 G.Cosmo
  - Created.
