                                         Test28
                                         ------

Description:   test of Wilson abrasion and EM disociation models for deuteron,
               alpha and heavy ion projectiles with energies 200 MeV and 1 GeV.

Type of test:  run to completion

Building:      This test has a special CMakeLists.txt to be used only by system
               testing.  It will not work when you run the test in stand-alone
               mode.  To do that you must:

               1. copy the test directory from geant4/tests to your working
                  directory

               2. replace the existing version of CMakeLists.txt with a
                  stand-alone one:

                  mv CMakeLists.txt CMakeLists.txtorig
                  mv CMakeLists_Standalone.txt CMakeLists.txt

               3. Clean up (if necessary) and re-configure, assuming a 64 bit
                  machine and Geant4 version 9.6:

                  rm test28
                  cmake .

              4. Build test28:

                 make -f Makefile 

Running:      Do

                 ./test28 test28.in >& test28.out &

              This throws 20 events per run.

Output:       run log
