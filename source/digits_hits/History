  digits_hits/utils and moved the G4ScoreNtupleWriter, G4ScoreNtupleWriterMessenger 
  classes in a new extended example analysis/B3aScoreWriter.

October 27th, 2018 I. Hrivnacova (digits_hits-V10-04-10)

October 26th, 2018 I. Hrivnacova (digits_hits-V10-04-08,09)
- Removed digiwdefs.hh (added in digits_hits-V10-04-06) - not used 

October 26th, 2018 J. Madsen (digits_hits-V10-04-07)
- Fix to Windows problems for G4ScoreNtupleWriter, it turns out that
  the issue was curiously not directly a DLL import/export problem but instead
  functions declared as static within the class being implemented outside
  the class (in the header) as inline -- which caused missing symbols on
  Windows similar to when DLLs are not exported/imported correctly

October 25th, 2018 I. Hrivnacova (digits_hits-V10-04-05,06)
- Added  DLLs import/export definitions for Windows

October 25th, 2018 I. Hrivnacova (digits_hits-V10-04-04)
- Avoid using static data of enum type in G4ScoreNtupleWriter
  (which seems to be causing problems on windows)

Oct 25th, 2018 J. Madsen (digits_hits-V10-04-03)
- updated G4THitsMap:
  - generic GetContainer(), size(), GetIndex(...), GetObject(...),
    begin(), end(), cbegin(), and cend()
- added G4THitsVector
  - generic GetContainer(), size(), GetIndex(...), GetObject(...),
    begin(), end(), cbegin(), and cend()
  - compatible with G4THitsMap such that vectors can be used to score
    over the course of a run (saving memory)
  - allows the underlying container to store data as non-pointer types
    e.g., G4VTHitsVector<T, std::vector<T>> with the default being
    G4VTHitsVector<T, std::vector<T*>>

October 25th, 2018 I. Hrivnacova (digits_hits-V10-04-02)
- Added G4ScoreNtupleWriter and its messenger which implement
  automated storing of hits collections of G4THitsMap<G4double>
  type (user by primitive scorers) vith Geant4 analysis tools.

  to incorrect parameter(s).
- This tag requires intercoms-V10-04-01 tag.

August 1, 2017 M. Asai (digits_hits-V10-03-02)
- G4SDStructure.cc : fix propagating warning flag. Addressing bug
  report #1993.

May 2, 2017 J. Madsen (digits_hits-V10-03-01)
- Update to G4THitsMap to fix issue where G4Colour was
  using G4THitsMap<G4StatDouble> and the allocation
  was causing += to white instead of += to black
  
April 20, 2017 J. Madsen (digit_hits-V10-03-00)
- Files modified : hits/include/G4THitsMap.hh
- Extension of the G4THitsMap class + bug fix
  - Renamed G4THitsMap to G4VTHitsMap
    - although G4VTHitsMap is not a pure virtual class
      it has an additional template parameter for the map
      type, so it is not intended to be used directly
  - Made G4VTHitsMap more generic in accepting the type
    of data stored (with more generic template overloads not
    specific to G4double and G4StatDouble)
  - Fixed a bug in initializing G4StatDouble entries
    - G4StatDouble(0) is not the same as G4StatDouble().
      The former starts off with a count = 1, and the
      latter starts with a count = 0.
  - Added G4THitsMap
    - deriving from G4VTHitsMap and having the same
      functionality as before
  - Added G4THitsMultiMap
    - which functions like G4THitsMap but all entries are
      stored
  - Added G4THitsUnorderedMap
    - which functions like G4THitsMap but uses an
      unordered_map
  - Added G4THitsUnorderedMultiMap
    - which functions like G4THitsMap but stores all
      entries in an unordered multimap
  - typedef for map_type, value_type, iterator, and const_iterator
    for future generic usage
    - e.g. replacing
      std::map<G4int, G4double*> theMap = this->GetMap()
      with
      map_type theMap = this->GetMap()
  - defined begin(), end(), cbegin(), cend() so now
    G4VTHitsMap can be used in range-based loops
    - e.g. for(auto itr : hitMap) { ... }
  
Nov 15, 2016, A.Dotti (digits_hits-V10-02-09,-10)
