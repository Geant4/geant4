May 31, 2007, A.Howard
- Removed classes associated with old biasing/scoring scheme:

Jul,  1st 2004 G.Cosmo
- G4CellScoreComposer.cc, G4TrackLogger.cc: trivial fix for extra
  semicolons, required for porting on gcc-3.4.0 compiler.

May,  3rd 2004 G.Cosmo
- G4SDManager, G4SDStructure: added optional argument 'warning' to
  FindSensitiveDetector(pathName, warning), defaulted to TRUE, to

  a new sensitive-detector is created automatically in their framework.
