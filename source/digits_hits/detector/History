                      Category History file
                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

August 9th, 2021 I. Hrivnacova (det-V10-07-01)
- Updated G4TScoreHistFiller for changes in the analysis category:
  removed deleting of the analysis manager,
  as this is now done by the Geant4 kernel.

April 1, 2021 B. Morgan (det-V10-07-00)
- Migrate build to modular CMake API

Sep 12, 2020 B. Morgan (det-V10-06-02)
- Apply typo fixes from Gurkan Myczko (https://github.com/Geant4/geant4/pull/15)

Sep 23, 2020  M.Asai (det-V10-06-01)
- G4VScoreHistFiller and G4TScoreHistFiller :
  Adding 2D and 3D histogram and 1P and 2P profile graph options.

Sep 7, 2020  M.Asai (det-V10-06-00)
- Introducing G4VScoreHistFiller and G4TScoreHistFiller that allow scorers to fill
  histograms defined by G4Analysis
- G4VPrimitivePlotter.hh is moved from digits_hits/util.

April 28, 2020  John Apostolakis
- Added ComputeSolid methods to G4VPrimitiveScorer

Febr 26, 2013 Andrea Dotti
- Adding cloning capbailities to SD

June 4, 2007, A.Howard
- Put back some classes required for scoring of geometrical biasing cells:
  G4CellScoreValues, G4CellScoreComposer
  (in module tag: "digits_hits-V08-03-03")

May 31, 2007, A.Howard
- Removed classes associated with old biasing/scoring scheme:
  G4CellScoreComposer, G4CellScoreValues, G4CellStoreScorer
  (in module tag: "digits_hits-V08-03-02")
- Files remain on the HEAD for testing purposes

Jul,  1st 2004 G.Cosmo
- G4CellScoreComposer.cc, G4TrackLogger.cc: trivial fix for extra
  semicolons, required for porting on gcc-3.4.0 compiler.

May,  3rd 2004 G.Cosmo
- G4SDManager, G4SDStructure: added optional argument 'warning' to
  FindSensitiveDetector(pathName, warning), defaulted to TRUE, to
  eventually exclude warning issued by G4SDManager when sensitive
  detector is not found.
  The fix has been requested by ALICE to deactivate the warning when
  a new sensitive-detector is created automatically in their framework.

Oct,  4th 2003 G.Cosmo
- Imported from digits+hits directory.

Nov,  4th 2002 M.Dressel
- Removed G4std:: where it does not belong to.

Oct  28th, 2002 M.Dressel
- Added G4CellScoreComposer[.hh.cc], G4CellScoreValues.hh,
  G4CellStoreScorer[.hh.cc], G4TrackLogger[.hh.cc].

June 6, 98 M.Asai
- Created.
