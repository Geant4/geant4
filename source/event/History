July 19 2001, F.Lei 
- Most commands under G4ParticleGun class are now available under GPS

    e.g..
    /gun/position => /gps/position
    /gun/direction => /gps/direction
    /gun/energy  => /gps/energy
   ...

- Implemented co-ordinates rotation for angular distribution. User defined
co-ordinates was an option available to user in the messenger but not
implemented internally in the older version gps.
Source angular distribution coupled with positional distribution can lead to
rather strange combinations. To avoid this I used a simple scheme in this
implementation:

- For cos-law angular distribution the default maxtheta is set to pi/2.
    instead of pi. The user can of course re-set this to any number between
        0 - pi.

- Added user defined histogram re-set method. After re-set user can
      redefine all the histograms. To use
        /gps/resethist  'histname'
-  Bug fixed in generating theta, and in calculating the weight.

- Added further guidance in the messenger for the definition of pre-defined
    energy distributions

Jul 18 2001, M.Asai (event-V03-02-02)
