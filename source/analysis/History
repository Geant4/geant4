This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  SVN log-message one should put at every
committal in the SVN repository !

June 03, 2014 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-06-31)
- Do not remove Root base file if ntuples are in use
  (this addresses problem report #1633)

April 25, 2014 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-06-30)
- Fixed implementation of compound commands in G4H[1,2,n]Messenger classes
  using new G4AnalysisUtilities::Tokenize() function.
  This allows to pass multi-word strings within "" and fixes problem report 
  #1616.
- Fixed G4H2ToolsManager::SetH2YAxisTitle: set title to y-axis and not x-axis.
  This addresses problem report #1620.  

April 16, 2014 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-06-29)
- Do not allow creating objects with empty names
  (this addresses problem report #1579)

March 12, 2014 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-06-28)
- Fixed H1, H2 functions to access xmin, xmax and width 
  (do not apply function and unit to return values)

March 10, 2014 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-06-27)
- Fixed bug in /analysis/h1/setAscii command 
  (introduced with refactoring messenger classes in analysis-V09-06-19)

January 21, 2014 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-06-26)

  Fixed performance observed for an ntuple with large numbers of columns
  reported in item #455 in Geant4 hypernews, Analysis category.
  See History_tools for complete list of modifications.

October 02, 2013 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-06-25)
- Do not call WriteH1[2]() when no histograms are defined.
  This allows to run application which uses only ntuples without
  a master instance of analysis manager.

September 30, 2013 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-06-24)
- Removed static G4AnalysisManager::Create(G4bool isMaster) function

- Reimplemented  G4AnalysisManagerState::IsMT() with use of
  G4Threading functions 
- Removed virtual declaration for GetH1, GetH2, GetNtuple functions
  in manager classes (to follow NVI pattern)
- Fixed installing of g4analysis_defs.hh  header
- Fixed g4csv.hh (it was overwritten by mistake with g4csv_defs.hh)
- Fixed g4csv_defs.hh (G4Ntuple is the ntuple type, and not a pointer)

September 17, 2013 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-06-23)
- Use thread Id (now available) in generating file names instead 
  of thread Pid.

September 02, 2013 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-06-22)
- Updated to g4tools 1.7.0 (by G. Barrand):
  Fixed problem report #1523 (incorrect setting the list of free blocks 
  in the ROOT file).

- New interface for functions in G4Threading.hh, 
  now in G4Threading namespace
  And also (I. Hrivnacova):
- Added a possibility to define logarithmic binning for H1 and H2
- Reorganized messenger classes per objects: they are now associated
  with the public interface (G4VAnalysisManager) 
- Fixed path to g4tools in test/build

August 1, 2013 I.Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-06-18)

- Fixed warnings on clang:
  Use struct keyword instead of class for forward declaration of structs.

July 11, 2013 I.Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-06-12)
- Refactoring manager classes:
  - Introduced managers per object types (H1, H2, Ntuple, File)
    and re-implemented G4VAnalysisManager as a composite of the objects
    managers
  - Removed enum G4VAnalysisManager::ObjectType and replaced related methods
    with methods per object type; eg.
      void  SetActivation(ObjectType type,  G4int id, G4bool activation);
    with
      void  SetH1Activation(G4int id, G4bool activation);
      void  SetH2Activation(G4int id, G4bool activation);

June 20, 2013 I.Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-06-11)
- Fixed the problem in Root files clean-up (manifested in 
  examples/advanced/microbeam):
  non-empty Root file was deleted when only ntuples and no histograms 
  were booked and the application was built against MT Geant4 but run 
  in sequential mode.

- Manager classes updated for MT:
  Added fgMasterInstance, fIsMaster data members and functions for 
  mergings histograms (Root, Xml) from worker tom master:
    void AddH1Vector(std::vector<tools::histo::h1d*>& h1Vector);
    void AddH2Vector(std::vector<tools::histo::h2d*>& h2Vector);
  These functions are automatically called on Worker::Write().
  Added ThreadId to ntuple file names when processing on workers.

  mode.

November 24 2001 I.Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-04-14)
- Updated to g4tools-1.0.5 (G. Barrand): 
  - wroot : streamers, buffer, wbuf, named :
            arrange to avoid the usage of the std::vector<>::data() method 
            which is quite not portable for the moment.
 - remove the no more needed (and problematic) tools/vdata file. 

November 24 2001 I.Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-04-13)
- tools/vdata: restored protection __GXX_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX0X__
  which got lost with update to  g4tools-1.0.4
 
November 24 2001 I.Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-04-12)
- Updated to g4tools-1.0.4 (G. Barrand):

    Adding a protection against an empty vector

  std::vector<>::data() feature, to allow compilation on Leopard systems.

October 27 2011 G.Cosmo (analysis-V09-04-09)
- Added workaround to use 'this' pointer for internal calls in histo/b1,
  to allow for compilation on Xcode on MacOX Lion.

October 18 2011 I.Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-04-08)
- Fix in CMakeLists.txt - adding new G4AnalysisVerbose.* files

October 17 2011 I.Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-04-07)
- Added support for H2 histograms
- Added verbose printing (for levels: 0,1,2)
- Updated to g4tools-1.0.2 (G. Barrand): 
  - Removed "inline" keyword for the methods having code implementation
    within classes. Dixit C++ docs, this kind of method is treated defacto 
    as "inline". The keyword "inline" remains or for functions or for the 
    few methods having their implementation outside the class.
  - Fixed some warnings (coming from Coverity or some specific version of g++) 
    about the lacking of calling the copy constructor of an inherited interface 
    in some copy constructors.
  - wroot/tree : have the streaming of the list of leaves. This permits to have
    the ROOT/TTree::Scan() method working when looking for a ntuple
    stored in a .root file as a TTree.

- Creating new tag because previous ones were not documented here!!

July 28 2011 B.Morgan (analysis-V09-04-01.5)
- CMakeLists.txt : Added to provide CMake build for G4Analysis. Implemented
  without using a sources.cmake because we only have one library, and tools
  headers need a specialized install to retain their nested structure.

July 28 2011 G. Cosmo
- Fix in tools/wroot/file to avoid gcc dependency error on WIN32 with CygWin.


July 28, 2011 B.Morgan
- Created History file for analysis module.
