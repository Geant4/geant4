  /analysis/ntuple/list  [onlyIfActive]

## 2022-11-25 Gabriele Cosmo (analysis-V11-00-26)
- Fixed compilation warnings for implicit type conversions on macOS/XCode 14.1.

## 2022-11-14 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V11-00-25)
- Added a protection against nullptr in G4VAnalysisManager::GetNofNtuples()
  - addressing the problem report #2518.

## 2022-11-09 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V11-00-24)
- Restored G4RootNtupleFileManager::CloseNtupleFiles()
  used in MPI overriding class

## 2022-11-03 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V11-00-23)
- Removed debug printing from G4XmlFileManager

## 2022-11-02 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V11-00-22)
- Coverity fixes:
  - Dead code (G4THnMessenger, G4RootFileManager)
  - Resource leak (G4NtupleMessenger)
  - Recursion in included headers (G4THnToolsManager, G4THnMessenger)

## 2022-10-28 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V11-00-21)
- Removed debug printing from G4AnalysisMessenger constructor

## 2022-10-21 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V11-00-20)
- Added new UI commands for analysis file management:

  - New commands in G4AnalysisMessenger class:
    /analysis/openFile, write, closeFile and reset
    New command in new G4GenericAnalysisMessenger class:
     /analysis/setDefaultFileType
  - Support also multiple write with/without calling write and/or reset
    in between two runs
  - Demonstrated (and tested) in new analysis example AnaEx03

  - Implementation details:
    - Do not broadcast commands for actions called at the end of run
      (write, reset and closeFile) and let master to execute action on workers
      and master in the right order
    - Added alternative private methods for Write, Reset and CloseFile
      with the name suffix FromUI, executed only on master
      and taking care of processing on workers in the right order
      - Make G4AnalyssMessenger friend class to give access to these functions
    - Added G4AnalysisState::fThreadId and its getter needed for
      accessing thread Id when triggering workers actions from master
    - Added a protection from calling OpenFile twice
    - Reset histograms on workers (G4THnManager.icc) after they were merged
      in master (otherwise they contribute again in the accumulation of data
      when successive write is called without previous reset)

## 2022-10-15 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V11-00-19)
- Corrected multiple write for ntuples with set file and activated merging
  (files n1.root and ntuples.root in test32)

## 2022-10-14 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V11-00-18)

  more suitable for adding members for handling ntuple cycles

## 2022-10-10 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V11-00-16)
- Implemented support for writing histograms in a file multiple times:
  - With the Root output type the object cycle number is attributed automatically
  - With other output types ,that do not support object cycles, the object name
    is appended with _vN, where N is the number of the write cycle, when the object
    is written more than once.
    No extension is added when the object is written for the first time (cycle 0).

    - G4THnToolsManager<DIM,HT> - replaces G4H*|P*Manager classes
    - G4THnMessenger - replaces G4H*|P*Messenger class
    - G4HnDimension - helper type to manipulate ndim, xmin, xmake parameters
      together
  - Updated classes:
    - G4THnManager: added a vector of pairs of histogram and information
      as a data member to simplify the access when both objects are used
    - Updated HnInformation structures functions to use compacted
      parameters
    - Updated functions in G4AnalysisUtilities:
      - Moved Check*, UpdateTitle functions in appropriate classes
      - Added G4Analysis::IsProfile<T>()
    - All messenger classes: replaced the usage of the analysis messenger helper

    - G4Plot* classes moved from managent in hntools
  - Removed classes
    - G4VH1Manager, etc. for H2, H3, P1, P2

## 2022-08-09 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V11-00-09)
- Refactored the of the analysis manager methods for file handlling from 
  the output specific managers in the common implementation in G4ToolsAnalysisManger. 
  Besides code simplification, this guaranties identical behavior with generic analysis 
  manager.
- Reviewed/fixed resetting data when postponed after CloseFile (for plotting)
- Fixes in deleting files: 
  do not delete (not empty) main ntuple files with generic analysis manager,
  delete empty ntuple csv and xml files created on the main thread

## 2022-08-01 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V11-00-08)

## 2022-07-13 I. Hrivnacova (analysis-V11-00-06)
- Added G4RootRFile type = a tuple for the Root read file including its directories,
  analogic to G4RootRFile for Root output, used now in the G4RootRfileManager::fRFiles
  map instead of tools::rroot::file.
  This allows deleting file directories in the class dtor, and should fix
  the Coverity defect (deleting local variable 'newDir' in G4RootRNtupleManager)

## 2022-05-18 Guy Barrand (analysis-V11-00-05)
- have "toolx" namespace for g4tools classes related to "externals", then:
  - tools::[hdf5,zlib,xml::xml_style,raxml,sg::text_freetype] become toolx::[hdf5,zlib,xml::xml_style,raxml,sg::text_freetype].
  - corresponding includes #include <tools/...> become #include <toolx/...>

- Fix notifying about closing file in G4GenericAnalysisManager;
  this fixes savinng scorers in analysis file in B3 example
  for the second and further runs.

  #include "g4analysis.hh"
  G4AnalysisManager* analysisManager = G4Analysis::ManagerInstance("root");

  Note that G4AnalysisManager is in this case G4ToolsAnalysisManager, and not
  the output type specific manager (eg. G4RootAnalysisManager), as it is
  in case of using a type specific include, eg. "g4root.hh"

  - Removed warning in CHBOOK/CHPWDF
  - Remove #ifdef WIN32 in wroot/date.

November 8 2011 G.Cosmo (analysis-V09-04-10)
- tools/vdata: restored protection __GXX_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX0X__ to use of
  std::vector<>::data() feature, to allow compilation on Leopard systems.

October 27 2011 G.Cosmo (analysis-V09-04-09)
- Added workaround to use 'this' pointer for internal calls in histo/b1,
  to allow for compilation on Xcode on MacOX Lion.

October 18 2011 I.Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-04-08)
- Fix in CMakeLists.txt - adding new G4AnalysisVerbose.* files

October 17 2011 I.Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-04-07)
- Added support for H2 histograms
- Added verbose printing (for levels: 0,1,2)
- Updated to g4tools-1.0.2 (G. Barrand):
  - Removed "inline" keyword for the methods having code implementation
    within classes. Dixit C++ docs, this kind of method is treated defacto
    as "inline". The keyword "inline" remains or for functions or for the
    few methods having their implementation outside the class.
  - Fixed some warnings (coming from Coverity or some specific version of g++)
    about the lacking of calling the copy constructor of an inherited interface
    in some copy constructors.
  - wroot/tree : have the streaming of the list of leaves. This permits to have
    the ROOT/TTree::Scan() method working when looking for a ntuple
    stored in a .root file as a TTree.

September 15 2011 I.Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-04-06)
- Added static access to specific manager classes.
- Migration to G4Exception for all warning/error messages.

August 4 2011 G.Cosmo (analysis-V09-04-05)
- Extended fix in tools/vdata for compilation error on olders GCC compiler
  versions (MacOSX 10.5, SLC4, ...). Addressing problem report #1238.

July 29 2011 G.Cosmo (analysis-V09-04-04)
- Fix in tools/vdata for compilation error in Intel ICC compiler.

July 28 2011 B.Morgan (analysis-V09-04-02)
- Creating new tag because previous ones were not documented here!!

July 28 2011 B.Morgan (analysis-V09-04-01.5)
- CMakeLists.txt : Added to provide CMake build for G4Analysis. Implemented
  without using a sources.cmake because we only have one library, and tools
  headers need a specialized install to retain their nested structure.

July 28 2011 G. Cosmo
- Fix in tools/wroot/file to avoid gcc dependency error on WIN32 with CygWin.


July 28, 2011 B.Morgan
- Created History file for analysis module.
