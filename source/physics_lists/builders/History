26-Apr-2017, Andrea Dotti       (phys-builders-V10-03-03, -04 -05)
- Next step in migration to new design to properly clean memory in MT mode
  G4BuilderInterface renamed G4PhysicsBuilderInterface and moved to run
  category
- Coworking tag: run-V10-03-08

17-Apr-2017, Andrea Dotti	    (phys-builders-V10-03-02)
- Workaround for compilation errror for MIC (that is actually a bug in the 
  compiler for MIC)

13-Apr-2017, Andrea Dotti	    (phys-builders-V10-03-01)
- Fix compilation warning

12-Apr-2017, Andrea Dotti	    (phys-builders-V10-03-00)
- New design with base class for all builders
- Add c++11 compatibility
- Removed unused class TheoModelFactory

  (instead of "ParticleHPInelastic")

19-Nov-2015, Alberto Ribon          (phys-builders-V10-01-05)

  typedef to G4NeutronPHPBuilder

05-Nov-2015, Alberto Ribon          (phys-builders-V10-01-04)
- Removed neutron_hp/ .

03-Nov-2015, Alberto Ribon          (phys-builders-V10-01-03)
- G4NeutronHPBuilder : migrated to ParticleHP. Now it is equivalent
  to G4NeutronPHPBuilder, so G4NeutronHPBuilder will be deleted soon.

06-April-2015, Andrea Dotti         (phys-builders-V10-01-02)
- Coverity fixes

17-March-2015, Vladimir Ivanchenko  (phys-builders-V10-01-01)

  G4DeuteronPHPBuilder, G4He3Builder, G4He3PHPBuilder,
  G4NeutronHPBuilder, G4NeutronLENDBuilder, G4NeutronPHPBuilder,
  G4ProtonPHPBuilder, G4TritonBuilder, G4TritonPHPBuilder
    removed deletion of cross section at exit to avoid double
    deletion

13-March-2015, Vladimir Ivanchenko  (phys-builders-V10-01-00)
- G4INCLXXNeutronBuilder, G4INCLXXProtonBuilder, G4INCLXXPionBuilder
    do not delete model and x-section at exit
- G4INCLXXPionBuilder - fixed pion cross section for pi-

12-Nov-2014, G.Folger               (phys-builders-V10-00-07)
- remove reference to G4INCLXXPiKBuilder.{hh,cc} from sources.cmake
 
07-Nov-2014, P. Arce          (phys-builders-V10-00-06)
- Add builders for particle_hp physics list

15-October-2014, Gabriele Cosmo		(phys-builders-V10-00-05)
- Added dependency to 'de_excitation/fission' module in GNUMakefile
  and sources.cmake, now required by INCLXX.

06-June-2014, Vladimir Ivanchenko	(phys-builders-V10-00-04)
- In all builders do not create a new instance of G4PreCompoundModel
    and G4ExcitationHandler to reduce number of its instances.
- Do not delete processes/models/cross sections in destructors
    of builders 

03-June-2014, Julia Yarba               (phys-builders-V10-00-03)
- Add G4QGSPLundStrFragmProtonBuilder(.hh and .cc) which outfits
  QGSP model with G4 LundStringFragmentation object (instead of the
  older G4QGSMFfragmentation); this appears to give better agreement
  with data at the energies above 100GeV (tested for proton+C)
- Set minimum energy for G4QGSPLundStrFragmProtonBuilder at 100GeV 

27-May-2014, Davide Mancusi             (phys-builders-V10-00-02)
- Convert G4INCLXXPiKBuilder to G4INCLXXPionBuilder.
- Set the maximum energy for G4INCLXXPionBuilder to 20 GeV.
- Add G4QGSPKaonBuilder.

09-May-2014, Vladimir Ivanchenko	(phys-builders-V10-00-01)
- OrderingParameterTable - processes "AnnihToMuMu" and "AnnihToHad"
    should not be active AtRest - fixed problem report #1598

06-Mar-2014, Alberto Ribon		(phys-builders-V10-00-00)
- Fixed memory leak in G4FTFBuilder.cc.

07-Nov-2013, Alberto Ribon		(phys-builders-V09-06-13)
- Removed low_energy and high_energy from sources.cmake and GNUmakefile.

  fixing an initialization problem in materials category.

19-Jul-2013, Alberto Ribon              (phys-builders-V09-06-07)
- Introduced a boolean parameter to the constructor of the class
  G4NeutronBuilder to switch on the fission process. The default
  is fission off, but for the HP-based physics lists it is activated.

- Added a new method to the builders: G4FTFBinaryNeutronBuilder,
                                      G4FTFBinaryProtonBuilder.

- Added a new method to the builders: G4FTFBinaryPionBuilder,
                                      G4FTFBinaryKaonBuilder.

08-Mar-2013, Davide Mancusi             (phys-builders-V09-06-03)

10-Jan-2013, Gunter Folger              (phys-builders-V09-06-00)
- new directory structure introduced. 
   builders directory only keeps hadronic builders, hadronic constructors moved to 
   constructors/hadron_inelastic
