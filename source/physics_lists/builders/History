22-Oct-2019  Alberto Ribon          (phys-builders-V10-05-02)
-  G4HyperonFTFPBuilder : replaced the Chips inelastic cross sections for
   hyperons and anti-hyperons with Glauber-Gribov ones (in this way, elastic
   and inelastic cross sections follows consistently the same approach).
-  G4BertiniKaonBuilder, G4BertiniPiKBuilder : replaced the Chips inelastic
   cross sections with Glauber-Gribov ones as default kaon cross sections.
-  G4FTFBinaryKaonBuilder, G4QGSBinaryKaonBuilder, G4QGSBinaryPiKBuilder,
   G4QGSPPiKBuilder, G4QGSPKaonBuilder : removed kaon cross sections
   (already set by the Bertini's builder, which is always needed).

06-Aug-2019  Alberto Ribon          (phys-builders-V10-05-01)
-  Replacing explicit values for the energy transition region with values
   from G4HadronicParameters, for nearly all builders.
   Note: kept unchanged the transition region between FTFP and BERT only
         in 4 cases: G4HadronPhysicsFTFP_BERT_ATL, G4HadronPhysicsINCLXX,
         G4HadronPhysicsNuBeam and "ShieldingM".

31-Jul-2019  Gunter Folger          (phys-builders-V10-05-00)
-  modified G4NeutronCrossSectionXS as consequence to code cleanup 
   in lists (phys-lists-V10-05-02),i.e. removed G4Dataquestionaire
   from util (phys-util-V10-04-02).
