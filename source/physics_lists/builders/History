# History entries prior to 11.0

14-Aug-2021 Vladimir Ivanchenko      (phys-builder-V10-07-08)

13-Jul-2021 Alberto Ribon            (phys-builder-V10-07-07)
- G4HadronicBuilder : initialized the vector mode, as suggested by Coverity.

16-April-2021 Ben Morgan             (phys-builder-V10-07-06)
- Migrate build to modular CMake API

13-April-2021  Alberto Ribon         (phys-builders-V10-07-05)
-  GNUmakefile, sources.cmake : removed dependency on hadronic/model/util
   and hadronic/model/management (that have been now deleted, with their
   classes moved to hadronic/util and hadronic/management).

18-March-2021  Alberto Ribon         (phys-builders-V10-07-04)
-  G4BinaryDeuteronBuilder, G4BinaryTritonBuilder, G4BinaryHe3Builder,
   G4BinaryAlphaBuilder : removed unused header files.
-  G4VNeutronBuilder, G4NeutronBuilder, G4NeutronPHPBuilder,
   G4NeutronLENDBuilder, G4PrecoNeutronBuilder,
   G4BertiniNeutronBuilder, G4BinaryNeutronBuilder, G4INCLXXNeutronBuilder,
   G4FTFPNeutronBuilder, G4QGSPNeutronBuilder,
   G4FTFBinaryNeutronBuilder, G4QGSBinaryNeutronBuilder :
   replace G4HadronCaptureProcess with G4NeutronCaptureProcess,
   and G4HadronFissionProcess with G4NeutronFissionProcess.

08-March-2021  Alberto Ribon         (phys-builders-V10-07-03)
-  G4PrecoNeutronBuilder, G4PrecoProtonBuilder, G4INCLXXNeutronBuilder,
   G4QGSBinaryKaonBuilder : replaced obsoleted cross sections
   (that have been deleted) with better ones.

   been deleted) with G4HadronInelasticProcess.

07-January-2021  Alberto Ribon       (phys-builders-V10-07-01)
-  G4HadronicBuilder : replaced 2-body decays of bottom mesons into
   charmed mesons and charged rho resonance, with 3-body decays into
   the same charmed mesons and charged pion and neutral pion.
   This allows to get a more precise numerical treatment of the decay
   kinematics in the rest frame, avoiding spurious energy-momentum
   violations reported by G4DecayProducts::IsChecked.

07-December-2020  Vladimir Ivanchenko (phys-builders-V10-07-00)
-  OrderingParameterTable - added forgotten processes (general
   positron, surface reflection, DNA) coherently with
   G4PhysicsListHelper

19-October-2020  Vladimir Ivanchenko (phys-builders-V10-06-13)
-  G4HadronicBuilder - added methods for FTFQGSP_BERT physics

17-September-2020  Alberto Ribon    (phys-builders-V10-06-12)

-  G4HadronicBuilder : added a new method, BuildDecayTableForBCHadrons,
   to create some decays for heavy (charmed and bottom) hadrons.
   This method is called by the methods BuildBCHadronsFTFP_BERT
   and BuildBCHadronsQGSP_FTFP_BERT only if the flag for heavy hadrons
   is enabled.

19-July-2020  Vladimir Ivanchenko   (phys-builders-V10-06-08)

     use, do not use Bertini cascade for b-, c - particles and
     anti-hyperons (only FTFP model)

30-June-2020  Vladimir Ivanchenko   (phys-builders-V10-06-07)
-  G4HadronicBuilder - added BuildElastic(..) method

-  G4HadronicBuilder - use G4PhysicsListHelper instead of G4ProcessManager,
     check G4HadronicParameters for b- and c- particles

15-May-2020  Vladimir Ivanchenko    (phys-builders-V10-06-03)
-  G4HadronicBuilder - new utility class to build kaons, hyperons,
     and b-, c- particles

07-May-2020  Alberto Ribon          (phys-builders-V10-06-02)
-  G4VHyperonBuilder, G4HyperonBuilder, G4HyperonQGSPBuilder : new classes
   to allow alternative builders for hyperons (and anti-hyperons).
   The class G4HyperonQGSPBuilder uses QGSP model to handle hyperons
   (and anti-hyperons) at high energies.
-  G4HyperonFTFPBuilder : now it derives from G4VHyperonBuilder
   (but the physics behind remains unchanged, i.e. it is still based
   on BERT and FTFP models).

05-May-2020  Alberto Ribon          (phys-builders-V10-06-01)
-  G4QGSPAntiBarionBuilder : created new class to handle anti_proton
   and anti_neutron at high energies with QGSP.
   For the light anti-ions (anti_deuteron, anti_triton, anti_He3, and
   anti_alpha), currently QGSP cannot handle them, therefore FTFP is used.

26-Feb-2020  Vladimir Ivanchenko    (phys-builders-V10-06-00)
-  revison of all classes of the sub-library: removed unnecessary
   members of classes; do not destruct models and cross sections;
   used updated instantiation of string models; these modifications
   should help to achieve full deletion of hadronic physics objects
   end of run

22-Oct-2019  Alberto Ribon          (phys-builders-V10-05-02)
-  G4HyperonFTFPBuilder : replaced the Chips inelastic cross sections for
   hyperons and anti-hyperons with Glauber-Gribov ones (in this way, elastic
   and inelastic cross sections follows consistently the same approach).
-  G4BertiniKaonBuilder, G4BertiniPiKBuilder : replaced the Chips inelastic
   cross sections with Glauber-Gribov ones as default kaon cross sections.
-  G4FTFBinaryKaonBuilder, G4QGSBinaryKaonBuilder, G4QGSBinaryPiKBuilder,
   G4QGSPPiKBuilder, G4QGSPKaonBuilder : removed kaon cross sections
   (already set by the Bertini's builder, which is always needed).

06-Aug-2019  Alberto Ribon          (phys-builders-V10-05-01)
-  Replacing explicit values for the energy transition region with values
   from G4HadronicParameters, for nearly all builders.
   Note: kept unchanged the transition region between FTFP and BERT only
         in 4 cases: G4HadronPhysicsFTFP_BERT_ATL, G4HadronPhysicsINCLXX,
         G4HadronPhysicsNuBeam and "ShieldingM".

31-Jul-2019  Gunter Folger          (phys-builders-V10-05-00)
-  modified G4NeutronCrossSectionXS as consequence to code cleanup
   in lists (phys-lists-V10-05-02),i.e. removed G4Dataquestionaire
   from util (phys-util-V10-04-02).

22-Nov-2018, Alberto Ribon          (phys-builders-V10-04-03)
-  G4QGSBinaryPionBuilder, G4QGSBinaryPiKBuilder, G4QGSPPiKBuilder,
   G4FTFPPionBuilder, G4BertiniPiKBuilder, G4FTFPPiKBuilder,
   G4BertiniPionBuilder, G4FTFBinaryPiKBuilder, G4BinaryPiKBuilder,
   G4INCLXXPionBuilder, G4FTFBinaryPionBuilder, G4BinaryPionBuilder,
   G4QGSPPionBuilder : use Barashenkov-Glauber-Gribov inelastic cross section
   for pions. This allows to avoid to use Gheisha cross sections for pion
   inelastic on Hydrogen target.

21-Nov-2018, Alberto Ribon          (phys-builders-V10-04-02)
- G4INCLXXPionBuilder : for inelastic pion cross sections at high energies,
  use Glauber-Gribov instead of Barashenkov, as for all the other builders.

17-Aug-2018, Vladimir Ivanchenko    (phys-builders-V10-04-01)
- G4FTFBinaryPiKBuilder, G4HyperonFTFPBuilder - improved deletion
- OrderingParameterTable - added gamma and e- processes

06-Aug-2018, Alberto Ribon	    (phys-builders-V10-04-00)

  G4FTFPPiKBuilder, G4QGSPLundStrFragmProtonBuilder, G4FTFPKaonBuilder,
  G4FTFPNeutronBuilder, G4QGSPProtonBuilder, G4QGSPKaonBuilder,
  G4QGSBinaryPionBuilder, G4FTFBinaryPiKBuilder, G4FTFBinaryNeutronBuilder,
  G4QGSBinaryProtonBuilder, G4QGSBinaryPiKBuilder, G4HyperonFTFPBuilder,
  G4FTFPAntiBarionBuilder, G4QGSBinaryKaonBuilder, G4FTFBinaryPionBuilder,
  G4QGSBinaryNeutronBuilder, G4QGSPPiKBuilder, G4FTFPPionBuilder,
  G4QGSPNeutronBuilder, G4FTFBinaryProtonBuilder :
  replaced the explicit high-energy limit of hadronic physics with the one
  from G4HadronicParameters .
