## 2023-10-20 Jean-Christophe David (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V11-01-02)
- Call G4HadronicBuilder::BuildAntiLightIonsINCLXX() to treat antiproton with INCLXX

## 2023-10-15 Vladimir Ivanchenko (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V11-01-01)
- G4HadronInelasticQBBC - more accurate instantiation of the neutron general process
- G4HadrocPhysicsQGSP_BERT_HP - used alternative HP models and cross sections

## 2023-04-19 Alberto Ribon (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V11-01-00)
- Created the new class G4HadronInelasticQBBC_ABLA, which is similar to
  G4HadronInelasticQBBC_ABLA, except that, for the final-state of nuclear
  inelastic interactions of charged pions and nucleons projectiles,
  the ABLA model (instead of the usual Precompound/de-excitation) is utilized
  for nuclear de-excitation.
  This is meant for testing purposes of the coupling between the hadronic
  string models (FTF and QGS) and ABLA (via G4GeneratorPrecompoundInterface),
  as well as of the coupling between intra-nuclear cascade models (BERT and BIC)
  and ABLA.
  In principle, these couplings with ABLA nuclear de-excitation can be
  extended to all types of projectiles, and to other reference physics lists,
  but, for the time being, in order to minimize code changes or new code,
  it is restricted to pion+, pion-, proton and neutron, and only for QBBC.

## 2022-11-11 Alberto Ribon (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V11-00-02)
- G4HadronPhysicsFTFP_BERT, G4HadronPhysicsINCLXX : extension to inelastic
  nuclear interactions of light hypernuclei (with either FTFP only or 
  FTFP+INCLXX) and anti-hypernuclei (with only FTFP for all energies).
  Notice that the QGSP string model cannot currently handle nuclear 
  projectiles of any kind.

## 2022-08-21 Vladimir Ivanchenko (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V11-00-01)
- G4HadronInelasticQBBC - use G4HadProcesses utility to build neutron 
    elastic, which allows to use an option of neutron general process

## 2021-12-10 Ben Morgan (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V11-00-00)
- Change to new Markdown History format

# History entries prior to 11.0

20-May-2021 Vladimir Ivanchenko (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V10-07-05)
- Migrate all constructors: printouts are controlled by verbosity level
  of G4HadronicParameters class; base class verboseLevel member is 
  not used; G4HadronicParameters singletone in initialized in all class
  constructors; if the verbosity level is defined in a class constructor
  it is propagated to G4HadronicParameters (user may change this level
  using UI command before physics is initialized); check versus 
  nullptr is used in several places

   is used now in all QGS-based inelastic physics constructor for hyperons
   (and anti-hyperons) at high energies (while keeping using

- Removed from photolepton_hadron/muon_nuclear from sources.cmake

14-Nov-2013, Alberto Ribon              (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V09-06-20)
- Use G4NeutronInelasticXS for neutrons in the following physics lists
  (besides QBBC and FTFP_BERT_TRV which already use it):
  FTFP_BERT, FTF_BIC, QGSP_FTFP_BERT, QGSP_BERT, QGSP_BIC, QGS_BIC.

08-Nov-2013, Alberto Ribon              (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V09-06-19)
- Removed low_energy and added fission to sources.cmake and GNUmakefile.

07-Nov-2013, Alberto Ribon              (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V09-06-18)
- Removed low_energy and high_energy from sources.cmake and GNUmakefile.

24-Sep-2013, Davide Mancusi             (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V09-06-17)
- Fix a possible null-pointer dereference in HadronPhysicsINCLXX.

22-Jul-2013, Alberto Ribon              (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V09-06-16)
- Nothing is changed: simply re-propose the previous tag after
  fixing an initialization problem in materials category.

19-Jul-2013, Alberto Ribon		(phys-ctor-hinelastic-V09-06-15)
- Replaced LEP neutron capture (Gheisha cross section and G4LCapture model)
  with G4NeutronCaptureXS (cross section) and G4NeutronRadCapture (model)
  in all physics lists.
- Removed LEP fission (Gheisha cross section and G4LFission model) in
  all physics lists which do not make use of neutron_HP.
  For the HP-based physics lists, used LEP fission only above 19.9 MeV.

18-Jun-2013, Alberto Ribon		(phys-ctor-hinelastic-V09-06-14)
- Re-enable quasiElastic in the signature of the constructors
  (but not in the implementation).

17-Jun-2013, Alberto Ribon		(phys-ctor-hinelastic-V09-06-13)
- Fixed compilation warnings (unused QuasiElastic).

12-Jun-2013, Gunter Folger              (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V09-06-12)
- in G4HadronPhysicsINCLXX.cc initialise pointers to optinal parts of
   physics to 0 to protect deletion of uninitialised pointer.

11-Jun-2013, Alberto Ribon		(phys-ctor-hinelastic-V09-06-11)
- Improved use of kaon cross sections in G4HadronPhysicsShielding.

09-Jun-2013, Andrea Dotti		(phys-ctor-hinelastic-V09-06-10)
- Fix for MT, make private data members TLS.

29-Mar-2013, Andrea Dotti		(phys-ctor-hinelastic-V09-06-09)
- Changes needed for MT: now G4VUserPhysicsList is a split class

19-Mar-2013, Alberto Ribon              (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V09-06-08)
- Fixed quasi-elastic treatment (on for QGS; off for FTF) of the
  previous tag.

19-Mar-2013, Alberto Ribon              (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V09-06-07)
- Replaced LEP with FTFP+BERT in all inelastic physics constructors.
- Depends on phys-builders-V09-06-05.

08-Mar-2013, Davide Mancusi             (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V09-06-06)
- Fix problem with overlapping model ranges.
- Depends on phys-builders-V09-06-03.

04-Mar-2013, Davide Mancusi             (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V09-06-05)
- Fix file/class name mismatch.

04-Mar-2013, Davide Mancusi             (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V09-06-04)
- Parametrized the INCL++ physics constructor to avoid code duplication for
  each INCL++-based physics list.

27-Feb-2013, Vladimir Ivanchenko        (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V09-06-03)
- G4HadronPhysicsFTFP_BERT, G4HadronPhysicsFTFP_BERT_HP - comment out
    unused members of the class to fix warning from the clang compiler
    on MacOS

22-Feb-2013, Davide Mancusi             (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V09-06-02)
- Modified constructor for QGSP_INCLXX to use PreCompound in nucleon-induced
  reactions below 2 MeV.
- Depends on tag phys-builders-V09-06-02.

08-Feb-2013, Vladimir Ivanchenko        (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V09-06-01)
- GNUmakefile fixed - G4LIB_BUILD_EXPAT is added

10-Jan-2012, Gunter Folger              (phys-ctor-hinelastic-V09-06-00)
- new directory structure introduced.
   constructors/hadron_inelastic classes
