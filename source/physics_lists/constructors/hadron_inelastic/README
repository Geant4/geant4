 neutron, pions and kaons, the FTFP is used above 9 GeV and BERT below 12 GeV
 (i.e. transition between these two models is in the interval [9, 12] GeV
  for the most frequent hadrons).

 low-energy neutrons:
 - neutron inelastic: use NeutronHP (for both cross section and final state)
                      below 20 MeV; above G4NeutronCaptureXS cross section;
                      final-state: BERT between 19.9 MeV and 6 GeV, 
                      FTFP above 3 GeV.

                    below 20 MeV; above Gheisha (cross section and final state).
 Moreover, RadioactiveDecay is activated (as in all the physics lists that use HP).

 ----------------------------

 G4HadronPhysicsFTF_BIC
 ----------------------
 Similar to G4HadronPhysicsFTFP_BERT, with the following differences:
