 (i.e. transition between these two models is in the interval [9, 12] GeV
  for the most frequent hadrons).


 G4HadronPhysicsFTFP_BERT_HP
 --------------------------
 Similar to G4HadronPhysicsFTFP_BERT, but with a different treatment of
 low-energy neutrons:
 - neutron inelastic: use NeutronHP (for both cross section and final state)
                      below 20 MeV; above G4NeutronCaptureXS cross section;
                      final-state: BERT between 19.9 MeV and 6 GeV,

 Moreover, RadioactiveDecay is activated (as in all the physics lists that use HP).


 G4HadronPhysicsFTFP_BERT_TRV
 ----------------------------
 The same as G4HadronPhysicsFTFP_BERT.


 G4HadronPhysicsFTF_BIC
 ----------------------
 Similar to G4HadronPhysicsFTFP_BERT, with the following differences:

 -  For pions, BIC is used below 1.5 GeV, whereas BERT is used in the
    interval 1 GeV < BERT < 6 GeV
 -  FTF is coupled with BIC (instead of directly to Precompound/de-excitation).

       taken from NeutronHP (both cross section and final-state).

 G4HadronPhysicsQGSP_BERT_HP
 ---------------------------
 Similar to G4HadronPhysicsQGSP_BERT, but with a different treatment of
 low-energy neutrons:
 - neutron inelastic: for cross section, use G4NeutronHPInelasticXS
                      below 20 MeV, and G4NeutronInelasticXS above;
		      for final-state model, use G4NeutronHPInelasticVI
                      below 20 MeV, BERT between 19.9 MeV and 6 GeV,
                      FTFP between 3 and 25 GeV, QGSP above 12 GeV. 
 - neutron capture: use G4NeutronHPCaptureXS cross section and
                    G4NeutronRadCaptureHP final-state model
		    (Note: if NuDEX is enabled (by default it is not),
		           then G4NuDEXNeutronCaptureModel final-state
			   model is used instead of G4NeutronRadCaptureHP).
 - neutron fission: use G4NeutronHPFissionXS cross section and
                    G4NeutronFissionVI final-state model.
 Moreover, RadioactiveDecay is activated (as in all the physics lists that use HP)
 Important warning: since G4 11.2, this constructor is different than all
                    other HP-based constructors for the treatment of neutrons
                    below 20 MeV : new "experimental" cross sections and
		    final-state models - which are different from the HP ones -
		    are utilised for testing, and therefore we recommend to
		    not using them for physics studies.

 - neutron fission: use NeutronHP (for both cross section and final state)
                    below 20 MeV; above Gheisha (cross section and final state).
 Moreover, RadioactiveDecay is activated (as in all the physics lists that use HP).


 G4HadronPhysicsQGSP_BIC_AllHP

       between FTFP and BERT for pions between 9.5 and 9.9 GeV
       (instead of 3-6 GeV).


 G4HadronPhysicsShieldingLEND
 ----------------------------
 Similar to G4HadronPhysicsShielding, except that LEND is used for neutrons
 below 20 MeV instead of NeutronHP.
 

 G4VHadronPhysics
 ----------------
 Utility class which provides useful methods.


 G4URRNeutrons
 -------------
 Physics list constructor that can be applied on top of any _HP or _HPT based
 physics list, to enable the special Unresolved Resonance Region (URR) treatment
 of low-energy neutrons based on Particle Table (PT).
 Notes:
 -  If this constructor is applied on top of a non-HP based physics list,
    then nothing changes and a warning is printed out.
 -  If this constructor is applied on top of a HP-based physics list,
    and the thermal scattering is applied after G4URRNeutrons, then
    there will be a problem of full overlappings between models.
    Therefore, if you need thermal scattering, activate it (e.g. by
    using a HPT-based physics list) before applying G4URRNeutrons.
