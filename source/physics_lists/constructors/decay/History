# Category phys-ctor-decay History

See `CONTRIBUTING.rst` for details of **required** info/format for each entry,
which **must** added in reverse chronological order (newest at the top). It must **not**
be used as a substitute for writing good git commit messages!

## 2023-11-07 Alberto Ribon (phys-ctor-decay-V11-01-01)
- G4RadioactiveDecayPhysics : replaced G4RadioactiveDecay with
  G4Radioactivation to be able to run in biasing mode (not only in
  analogue mode, as before with G4RadioactiveDecay).

## 2023-01-11 Alberto Ribon (phys-ctor-decay-V11-01-00)
- G4RadioactiveDecayPhysics : assigned the RadioactiveDecay process
  to G4Triton (which is the only light ion that decays).
  Note: before, triton did not have beta decay, i.e. it was wrongly
  treated as stable even when radioactive decay physics was enabled;
  anti_triton did not, and still does not, have beta decay
  (because RadioactiveDecay, in its current implementation, does
  not handle any kind of anti-ions): in practice, this is an acceptable
  approximation because of its relatively long lifetime and the fact
  that annihilation and nuclear capture are more likely to happen
  before decay.

## 2022-11-16 Vladimir Ivanchenko (phys-ctor-decay-V11-00-03)
- added calls to G4EmBuilder and G4PhysListUtil in order to 
  prevent from warnings on hyper-nuclei decays in the case of 
  simplified custom Physics List

## 2022-08-16 Alberto Ribon (phys-ctor-decay-V11-00-02)
- sources.cmake : added missed dependency on G4physlist_util

## 2022-08-09 Vladimir Ivanchenko (phys-ctor-decay-V11-00-01)
- G4DecayPhysics - added instantiation of singletones for physics

## 2021-12-10 Ben Morgan (phys-ctor-decay-V11-00-00)

- Migrate build to modular CMake API

13-April-2021 Alberto Ribon             (phys-ctor-decay-V10-07-00)
-  GNUmakefile, sources.cmake : removed dependency on hadronic/model/util
   and hadronic/model/management (that have been now deleted, with their
   classes moved to hadronic/util and hadronic/management).

18-August-2020 Vladimir Ivanchenko      (phys-ctor-decay-V10-06-05)
- G4RadioactiveDecayPhysics - defined EM parameters in ConstructProcess(..)
    instead definition inside the constructor

02-July-2020 Vladimir Ivanchenko        (phys-ctor-decay-V10-06-04)
- G4RadioactiveDecayPhysics - improved initialisation: added
    EM parameters definition in the class constructor; if atomic
    de-excitation is not defined add it in each thread but not
    change EM parameters in a thread; should address several
    problems reported recently in the Forum and privately

03-June-2020 Vladimir Ivanchenko        (phys-ctor-decay-V10-06-03)
- G4RadioactiveDecayPhysics - coherent initialisation with recent
    updates of initialisation of atomic de-excitation

30-Apr-2020 Ben Morgan                  (phys-ctor-decay-V10-06-02)
- Remove obsolete GRANULAR_DEPENDENCIES entries

18-February-2020 Vladimir Ivanchenko    (phys-ctor-decay-V10-06-01)
- G4DecayPhysics, G4RadioactiveDecayPhysics, G4SpinDecayPhysics,
  G4UnknownDecayPhysics - general cleanup: removed thread local
    pointers, do not delete objects, use C++11 keywords, use
    standard signatures for constructors; define bulder type for
    the main constructor G4DecayPhysics - bDecay, for others bUnknown,

13-February-2020 Vladimir Ivanchenko    (phys-ctor-decay-V10-06-00)

25 June 2019  Dennis Wright (phys-ctor-decay-V10-05-00)

  is generally not used in the physics lists.

07-July-2018 Vladimir Ivanchenko        (phys-ctor-decay-V10-04-00)
