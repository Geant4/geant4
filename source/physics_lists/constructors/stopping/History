# History entries prior to 11.0

16-April-2021 Ben Morgan             (phys-ctor-stopping-V10-07-01)
- Migrate build to modular CMake API

13-Apr-2021, Alberto Ribon              (phys-ctor-stopping-V10-07-00)
-  GNUmakefile, sources.cmake : removed dependency on hadronic/model/util
   and hadronic/model/management (that have been now deleted, with their
   classes moved to hadronic/util and hadronic/management).

30-Apr-2020, Ben Morgan                 (phys-ctor-stopping-V10-06-01)
-  Remove obsolete GRANULAR_DEPENDENCIES entries

21-Feb-2020, Vladimir Ivanchenko        (phys-ctor-stopping-V10-06-00)
- cleanup of all constructors: fixed names; make all constructor
  signatures universal, removed thread local members, added c++11
  keywords

22-Oct-2019, Alberto Ribon              (phys-ctor-stopping-V10-05-02)
- REAMDE : updated.

06-Aug-2019, Alberto Ribon              (phys-ctor-stopping-V10-05-01)
- G4StoppingPhysicsFritiofWithBinaryCascade : new class to handle the
  nuclear capture at rest of negatively charged particles. It is similar
  to G4StoppingPhysics, with the only difference that Fritiof coupled with
  Binary Cascade is used (instead of FTFP) for anti-proton and anti-neutron
  annihilation at rest.

22-May-2019, Alberto Ribon              (phys-ctor-stopping-V10-05-00)
- Use FTFP also for the annihilation at rest of neutral anti-hadrons:
  anti-neutron, anti-lambda, anti-sigma0 anti-xi0.
  Note: this extension is for completeness and practical convenience,
        although physically neutral hadrons should never be completely
        at rest!

03-Nov-2016, Alberto Ribon              (phys-ctor-stopping-V10-02-02)
- Written first draft of the README

16-October-2016, Michel Maire           (phys-ctor-stopping-V10-02-01)
- add README

11-Oct-2016, Gunter Folger              (phys-ctor-stopping-V10-02-00)
- replace direct use of aParticleIterator by GetParticleIterator().

05-Nov-2015, Alberto Ribon              (phys-ctor-stopping-V10-01-00)
- Replaced neutron_hp/ with particle_hp/

29-Jan-2014, Gunter Folger              (phys-ctor-stopping-V10-00-00)
- Removed from photolepton_hadron/muon_nuclear from sources.cmake

07-Nov-2013, Alberto Ribon 		(phys-ctor-stopping-V09-06-03)
- Removed low_energy and high_energy from sources.cmake and GNUmakefile.

08-Jun-2013, Andrea Dotti 		(phys-ctor-stopping-V09-06-02)
- Bug fixing for MT: make wasActivated flag TLS and remove private
  data member making them local variables in ConstructProcess

29-Mar-2013, Andrea Dotti		(phys-ctor-stopping-V09-06-01)
- Changes needed for MT: now G4VUserPhysicsList is a split class

10-Jan-2013, Gunter Folger              (phys-ctor-stopping-V09-06-00)
- new directory structure introduced.
   constructors/stopping classes
