See `CONTRIBUTING.rst` for details of **required** info/format for each entry,
which **must** added in reverse chronological order (newest at the top). It must **not**
be used as a substitute for writing good git commit messages!

# History entries prior to 11.0

16-April-2021 Ben Morgan                (phys-ctor-fact-V10-07-01)
- Migrate build to modular CMake API

13-Apr-2021 Alberto Ribon               (phys-ctor-fact-V10-07-00)
-  GNUmakefile, sources.cmake : removed dependency on hadronic/model/util
   and hadronic/model/management (that have been now deleted, with their
   classes moved to hadronic/util and hadronic/management).

30-Apr-2020 Ben Morgan                  (phys-ctor-fact-V10-06-00)
- Remove obsolete GRANULAR_DEPENDENCIES entries

16-Mar-2018, Robert Hatcher             (phys-ctor-fact-V10-04-02)
- Allows override of exclusion of G4RegisterPhysicsConstructors.icc
   when using WIN32 by setting USING_STATIC_LIBS

28-Feb-2018, Robert Hatcher             (phys-ctor-fact-V10-04-01)
- WIN32 linker works differently then Unix for externals in shared mode
  Special case WIN32 (for both shared & static builds for now)

26-Feb-2018, Robert Hatcher             (phys-ctor-fact-V10-04-00)
- Move G4_REFERENCE_PHYSCONSTR_FACTORY macro calls out of
  G4PhysicsConstructorRegistry.cc, where they cause an implicit
  circular link when building granular libraries, and into a new
  G4RegisterPhysicsConstructors.icc, where they can be included
  as necessary in a higher level compilation unit.
- REFERENCE macro calls can be made unique by #define REGREF <anything>
- Whitespace cleanup

01-May-2017, Sebastien Incerti          (phys-ctor-fact-V10-03-00)
- added Geant4-DNA stationary constructors

17-Oct-2016, Michel Maire               (phys-ctor-fact-V10-02-04)
- add README

29-Sep-2016, Robert Hatcher             (phys-ctor-fact-V10-02-03)
- Reviewed changes in current context, propose w/ minimal changes

03-Jun-2016, Robert Hatcher             (phys-ctor-fact-V10-02-02)
- Require use of declaring and referencing macros to have
  a trailing semicolon; for case where macro expands to a
  namespace block, deal with eating up the ";"

26-May-2016, Robert Hatcher             (phys-ctor-fact-V10-02-01)
- Implement G4_REFERENCE_PHYSCONSTR_FACTORY_NS in case physics
   ctor lives in a namespace

10-May-2016, Robert Hatcher             (phys-ctor-fact-V10-02-00)
- Reinstate use of G4_REFERENCE_PHYSCONSTR_FACTORY so that registry works
   in the case of static library builds, even without forcing linker
   to load whole library (which is not possible for MS Visual Studio)

05-Nov-2014, Alberto Ribon              (phys-ctor-fact-V10-01-00)
- Replaced neutron_hp/ with particle_hp/

04-Nov-2014, Robert Hatcher             (phys-ctor-fact-V10-00-02)
- Resubmit with new tag

04-Nov-2014, Robert Hatcher             (phys-ctor-fact-V10-00-01)
- Add macro for declaring phys constructors in a namespace to factory.
- Methods for G4PhysicsConstructorRegistry to report known constructors.

29-Jan-2014, Gunter Folger              (phys-ctor-fact-V10-00-00)
- Removed electromagnetic/dna, cascade/{evaporation,utils}, and
   isotope_production from sources.cmake

07-Nov-2013, Alberto Ribon              (phys-ctor-fact-V09-06-03)
- Removed low_energy and high_energy from sources.cmake and GNUmakefile.

29-Jan-2013, Gunter Folger              (phys-ctor-fact-V09-06-02)
- fix sources.cmake for moved files

29-Jan-2013, Gunter Folger              (phys-ctor-fact-V09-06-01)
- move G4PhysListFactory from constructor/factory to lists.

10-Jan-2012, Gunter Folger              (phys-ctor-fact-V09-06-00)
- new directory structure introduced.
   constructors/factory classes
