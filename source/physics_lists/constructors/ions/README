 G4IonBinaryCascadePhysics
 -------------------------
 Inelastic ion-ion processes (for deuteron, triton, He3, alpha and
 generic ion projectiles), with Glauber-Gribov cross section and
 Binary Light Ion (BIC, with Precompound/de-excitation) and Fritiof (FTF)
 string model (with Precompound/de-excitation) for the final state.
 BIC is used for projectiles of kinetic energies below 6 GeV/nucleon, and
 FTF above 3 GeV/nucleon.
 
 G4IonINCLXXPhysics
 ------------------
 Inelastic ion-ion processes (for deuteron, triton, He3, alpha and
 generic ion projectiles), with Glauber-Gribov cross section and
 INCLXX and FTFP for the final state. INCLXX is used below 3 GeV/nucleon,
 and FTF above 2.9 GeV/nucleon.
 
 G4IonPhysics
 ------------
 Currently equivalent to G4IonBinaryCascadePhysics.

 G4IonPhysicsPHP
 ---------------
 Similar to G4IonBinaryCascadePhysics, except that ParticleHP (for both
 cross sections and final states) is used below 200 MeV/n for deuteron,
 triton, He3 and alpha (and BIC used above 190 MeV/n for these light ions).

 G4IonQMDPhysic
 --------------
 Inelastic ion-ion processes (for deuteron, triton, He3, alpha and
 generic ion projectiles), with Glauber-Gribov cross section and
 BIC, QMD and FTFP for the final state. These three final-state models
 are used in the following intervals of projectile kinetic energy:
 -  BIC below 110 MeV/nucleon;
 -  QMD between 100 and 10'000 MeV/nucleon;
 -  FTF above 9990 MeV/nucleon.
