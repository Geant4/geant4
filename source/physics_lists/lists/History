19-April-2017 V.Ivanchenko  (phys-lists-V10-03-02)
- G4PhysListFactory - fixed  EM option "__SS" - problem report #1966

21-March-2017 Koi, Tatsumi (phys-lists-V10-03-01)
- Fix problem of LBE physics list on radioactive decay model 


07-February-2017 V.Ivanchenko  (phys-lists-V10-03-00)
- G4PhysListFactory - add single scattering EM option (required by
    several user groups), one need to add "__SS" to the reference
    physics list name

12-October-2016 G.Folger  (phys-lists-V10-02-10)
- remove direct use of theParticleIterator, get this from G4ParticleTable.
    fix required by clang39 on Windows and MAC

29-Sep-2016, Robert Hatcher               (phys-lists-V10-02-09)
- Reviewed changes in current context, propose w/ minimal changes

03-Jun-2016, Robert Hatcher               (phys-lists-V10-02-08)
- Require use of declaring and referencing macros to have
  a trailing semicolon; for case where macro expands to a
  namespace block, deal with eating up the ";"

26-May-2016, Robert Hatcher               (phys-lists-V10-02-07)
- Fix issue where G4PhysListRegistry didn't properly exit if
  a requested extension didn't exist in its list. 
- Add G4_REFERENCE_PHYSLIST_FACTORY[_NS] for pulling in lists
  from static libraries.

26-May-2016, Alberto Ribon                (phys-lists-V10-02-06)

- mv src/G4RegisterPhysLists.cc to include/G4RegisterPhysLists.icc
  so that it gets compiled as part of the G4PhysListRegistry compilation
  unit.  This ensures that all the physics lists declared to the
  registry are referenced by it such that the linker will include
  them if libraries are built statically, even when the loader
  doesn't force whole-archive (not possible for MS Visual Studio) loading.
- Fix exception label so it is unique.

06-Apr-2016, Alberto Ribon                (phys-lists-V10-02-04)

  "error-free" stepping. This is done for the purpose of studying
  the impact of multiple scattering on hadronic showers.

23-Feb-2016, Alberto Ribon                (phys-lists-V10-02-02)
- FTFP_BERT_TRV : Use GS multiple scattering with the more precise option,
  (Opt3), instead of the default (Opt0). This is done for the purpose of
  studying the impact of multiple scattering on hadronic showers.
