22-October-2019  Alberto Ribon (phys-lists-V10-05-04)
 - FTFP_BERT_HP, QGSP_BERT_HP, INCLXXPhysicsListHelper : added (consistently)
   RadioactiveDecay to all physics lists which use NeutronHP (the rationale
   is that precision is more valuable than speed for these physics lists;
   note that, among the reference physics lists with NeutronHP, only 
   FTFP_BERT_HP, QGSP_BERT_HP, FTFP_INCLXX_HP and QGSP_INCLXX_HP did not have
   RadioactiveDecay activated by default).

06-August-2019  Alberto Ribon (phys-lists-V10-05-03)
 - FTF_BIC, QGS_BIC : use the newly introduced stopping physics constructor
   G4StoppingPhysicsFritiofWithBinaryCascade (instead of the default
   G4StoppingPhysics).

               with values from G4HadronicParameters.

03-Jun-2016, Robert Hatcher               (phys-lists-V10-02-08)

- mv src/G4RegisterPhysLists.cc to include/G4RegisterPhysLists.icc
  so that it gets compiled as part of the G4PhysListRegistry compilation
  unit.  This ensures that all the physics lists declared to the
  registry are referenced by it such that the linker will include
  them if libraries are built statically, even when the loader
  doesn't force whole-archive (not possible for MS Visual Studio) loading.
