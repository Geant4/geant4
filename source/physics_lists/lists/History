   match old factory

24-November-2020  Alberto Ribon (phys-lists-V10-06-02)
 - LBE : added G4ShortLivedConstructor (to avoid crashes, e.g. when rho0

   note that, among the reference physics lists with NeutronHP, only
   FTFP_BERT_HP, QGSP_BERT_HP, FTFP_INCLXX_HP and QGSP_INCLXX_HP did not have
   RadioactiveDecay activated by default).
