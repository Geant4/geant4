- Added schema definition files.

10 June 2008 Zoltan Torzsok (gdml-V09-01-06)

- Only the referenced solids are written out, not the whole solid store.

23 May 2008 Zoltan Torzsok
- Writer: precision is now considered in case of scale, rotation and position
  of the physical-volume. DBL_EPSILON is used to filter precision for avoiding
  unnecessary scaling, rotation or positioning.

6 May 2008 Zoltan Torzsok (gdml-V09-01-04)
- Added a constant limiting the maximum number of reflections/displacements of a single solid

10 April 2008 Zoltan Torzsok
- Added text output to console to inform of progress during processing.

9 April 2008 Zoltan Torzsok
- Worked out an algorithm for sorting logical volumes in the writer.

4 April 2008 Zoltan Torzsok

14 February 2008 Z.Torzsok
- Replica volumes added to writer and succesfully tested.

13 February 2008 Z.Torzsok

  converts rotation angles into a rotation matrix. This wad used in physvol,
  reflectedSolid and boolean solid. Now this conversion is in one place
- Added 'firstrotation' and 'firstposition' to boolean solid. Now the first
  solid can be transformed too (Boolean solid is succesfully tested).

11 February 2008 Z.Torzsok
- Added matrices to writer.
- Exception handling is added to loops (identify infinite loops).

8 Febryary 2008 Z.Torzsok

- Hype, orb and para added to writer.
  Succesfully tested, except the para.

1 February 2008 Z.Torzsok
- Ellipsoid and elliptical-tube added to writer.

31 January 2008 Z.Torzsok
- Quantities now can be referenced
- Naming of physical volumes changed: MotherLogicalName_daughter(index)

30 January 2008 Z.Torzsok
- If there is only one setup defined, name does not matter, that setup
  will be loaded.
- Temperature, pressure and state are now processed in the reader.
  Added Nist support.

28 January 2008 Z.Torzsok
- Element added to writer.
- Polyhedra and torus added to writer.
- Now the package is able to read/write the CMS geometry.

25 January 2008 Z.Torzsok
- Bugs fixed in the writer in G4GMLWriteStructure::physvolWrite():
  the signs of the rotational angles were incorrect in certain cases
  (180 degrees, 90 degrees,...). The reflection was incorrect in case
  of reflecting a subtree.
- Now the package is capable of reading and writing back the LHCb
  geometry correctly.

23 January 2008 Z.Torzsok
- Composite materials added to writer.
- Cone and tube added to writer.
- Boolean solid (intersection, subtraction, union) added to writer.

22 January 2008 Z.Torzsok
- Extruded solid is added to writer.
- Reflected solid is removed from the written GDML files.
  Scale transformation is used instead.
- Optimization to tha case of reading multiple GDML files and writing out
  into a single GDML file:
  The mother volume is moved to the end of the list after its daugthers are
  processed... only when necessary, when new logical volumes come from the
  daughters!

21 January 2008 Z.Torzsok
- Reflected solid is added to the writer.
- Solved problem of reading multiple GDML files and writing out into a single
  GDML file:
  if a logical volume (let's say the mother volume) is instantiated, it will
  be added to the end of list of volumes (G4LogicalVolumeStore).
  Once this logical volume is instantiated we can add daughters.
  If a daughter refers to an external file, additional logical volumes will
  come. These logical volumes will be added to the list as well, AFTER the
  mother volume. In the mother volume these logical volumes can be referenced
  ...but these logical volumes are not instantiated yet when we instantiate
  the mother! That's why we move the mother volume at the end of the list
  after the daughters are processed.
  
18 January 2008 Z.Torzsok
- The class hierarchy of the GDML parser/writer is finished:
  Write <- WriteDefine <- WriteMaterials <- WriteSolids
        <- WriteSetup <- WriteStructure
  Parser Read <- ReadDefine <- ReadMaterials <- ReadSolids
              <- ReadSetup <- ReadParamvol <- ReadStructure.
