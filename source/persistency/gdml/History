  solid can be transformed too (Boolean solid is succesfully tested).

- Polyhedra and torus added to writer.
- Now the package is able to read/write the CMS geometry.

25 January 2008 Z.Torzsok
- Bugs fixed in the writer in G4GMLWriteStructure::physvolWrite():
  the signs of the rotational angles were incorrect in certain cases
  (180 degrees, 90 degrees,...). The reflection was incorrect in case
  of reflecting a subtree.
- Now the package is capable of reading and writing back the LHCb
  geometry correctly.

23 January 2008 Z.Torzsok

22 January 2008 Z.Torzsok
- Extruded solid is added to writer.
- Reflected solid is removed from the written GDML files.
  Scale transformation is used instead.
- Optimization to tha case of reading multiple GDML files and writing out
  into a single GDML file:
  The mother volume is moved to the end of the list after its daugthers are
  processed... only when necessary, when new logical volumes come from the
  daughters!

21 January 2008 Z.Torzsok
- Reflected solid is added to the writer.
- Solved problem of reading multiple GDML files and writing out into a single
  GDML file:
  if a logical volume (let's say the mother volume) is instantiated, it will
  be added to the end of list of volumes (G4LogicalVolumeStore).
  Once this logical volume is instantiated we can add daughters.
  If a daughter refers to an external file, additional logical volumes will
  come. These logical volumes will be added to the list as well, AFTER the
  mother volume. In the mother volume these logical volumes can be referenced
  ...but these logical volumes are not instantiated yet when we instantiate
  the mother! That's why we move the mother volume at the end of the list
  after the daughters are processed.
  
18 January 2008 Z.Torzsok
- The class hierarchy of the GDML parser/writer is finished:
  Write <- WriteDefine <- WriteMaterials <- WriteSolids
