This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

Jan 25th, 2021 Makoto Asai (tasking-V10-06-14)
- G4WorkerTaskRunManager.cc : Correct the way to count the number of events
  processed in a worker thread. This correction also fixes a rare crash due to
  accessing to the seed vector more than necessary.
- G4TaskRunManager.cc : Reduce number of events per task to evenly distribute
  evnets to all available threads.

Nov 12th, 2020 Jonathan Madsen (tasking-V10-06-13)
- Added G4Profiler support
- Removed TIMEMORY_AUTO_TIMER

Nov 12th, 2020, B. Morgan (tasking-V10-06-12)
- G4RunManagerFactory : simplify logic of choosing type from function
  inputs or environment. Provide new "SerialOnly"... entries for G4RunManagerType
  to allow users to force use of a specific (but available) type.

Nov 4th, 2020, M. Asai (tasking-V10-06-11)
- G4TaskRunManager.cc : not resetting the run ID counter for the
  run initialization except the first run.

Oct 28th, 2020, M. Asai (tasking-V10-06-10)
- G4RunManagerFactory : Set default run manager type to MT for
  release 10.7.

Oct 20th, 2020, J. Madsen (tasking-V10-06-09)
- Implemented GetMasterRunManager in G4RunManagerFactory
- Added DoCleanup() for worker task run managers
- Replaced worker DoWork(int) with DoWork()
- Resolved issues with G4Run number of events to be processed
- Resolved issues with G4Run number of events processed

Sept 23rd, 2020, B. Morgan (tasking-V10-06-08)
- Remove no longer required include_directories

Sept 21st, 2020 J. Madsen (tasking-V10-06-07)
- Added checks for currentRun before calling routines with currentRun
- updated docs using G4RunManagerCreator instead of G4RunManagerFactory
- G4WorkerTaskRunManager: minor tweaks to ProcessUI
- G4TaskRunManagerKernel: memory cleanup + initCmdStack
- G4TaskRunManager:
    - appears to fix previous issues with geometry changes
    - inherited scoring-worlds, master-worlds, fMasterRM data from G4MTRunManager
    - CreateAndStartWorkers processes command stack on second fakeRun
    - cleaned up header

Sept 12th, 2020, J. Madsen (tasking-V10-06-06)
- Tasking stability fixes
- removed a bunch of excess functions from G4WorkerTaskRunManager
- Got rid of regular task group vs. TBB task group implementation
  - this is thanks to the generic execute_on_all_threads function

July 17th, 2020, I. Hrivnacova (tasking-V10-06-05)
- Adding call to G4VScoreNtupleWriter in G4WorkerTaskRunManager,
  which missing was causing a break in B4d basic example.

June 22nd, 2020, G. Cosmo (tasking-V10-06-04)
- Fixed recursive inclusion in G4TaskRunManager.

June 18th, 2020, G. Cosmo (tasking-V10-06-03)
- Added DLL macros for Windows build.
- Fixed cases of static inline methods and static symbols to export
  in G4TaskRunManager and G4RunManagerFactory. Some code cleanup for
  use of G4 types.
- Fixed compilation warnings for unused mutexes in G4TaskRunManager
  and G4WorkerTaskRunManager.

June 17th, 2020, G. Folger
- Fixes for Windows: in G4TaskRunManager, replaced direct access to
  static data by access functions.

June 10th, 2020, J. Madsen
- Updated README.md
- generated README via `pandoc -f markdown -t plain -o README README.md`
- generated .README.txt via `pandoc -f markdown -t latex -o .README.txt README.md`

June 10th, 2020, J. Madsen (tasking-V10-06-02)
- Fixed numberOfEventsPerTask < nworker reproducibility
- Migrated G4RunManagerCreator to own header/source
- cleaned up sources.cmake

June 4th, 2020, J. Madsen (tasking-V10-06-01)
- Added G4TaskRunManager constructor overload taking boolean
  for whether to use TBB
- Added warning if using TBB is requested but no compile support
- Default arguments in G4TaskRunManager query G4USE_TBB environment
  variable to set default bool
