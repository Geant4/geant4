-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2025-09-10 Gabriele Cosmo (fastsimchanneling-V11-03-02)
- Fixed compilation warnings on macOS/XCode for implicit type conversions
  in G4VChannelingFastSimCrystalData.

## 2025-08-16 Alexei Sytov (fastsimchanneling-V11-03-01)
- Considerable updates of functionality:
- Introduced reading from an input file of custom internal geometry of
  a periodically bent crystal which also works, if necessary, with multiple
  input files, each per logical volume of an oriented crystal;
- Introduced various types of radiation virtual collimators in
  G4BaierKatkov;
- Deleted redundant lines setting up the defaults of angular and low
  energy cuts in void G4ChannelingFastSimModel::Input;
- Polishing of the code according to the Geant4 guidelines.
  NOT AFFECTING THE CURRENT VERSION OF EXISTING EXAMPLES ch1, ch2, ch3.

## 2025-04-06 Dmitri Konstantinov (fastsimchanneling-V11-03-00)
- In G4VChannelingFastSimCrystalData::IonizationLosses(), fixed bug
  in the electron ionization loss correction formula.
  Issue was spotted by PVS-Studio static analysis.

## 2024-11-11 Gabriele Cosmo (fastsimchanneling-V11-02-04)
- Fixed compilation warnings on macOS/XCode for implicit type conversions
  in G4CoherentPairProduction.

## 2024-10-22 Alexei Sytov (fastsimchanneling-V11-02-03)
- Added new process G4CoherentPairProduction for the simulation
  of coherent pair production by high energy gamma in an oriented crystal.
  IMPORTANT: it works as a G4VDiscreteProcess, not as a parameterisation.
  IMPORTANT: it uses G4ChannelingFastSimCrystalData.
- sources.cmake updated accordingly

## 2024-09-17 Vladimir Ivanchenko (fastsimchanneling-V11-02-02)
- G4VChannelingFastSimCrystalData - fixed Coverity warning

## 2024-08-30 Alexei Sytov (fastsimchanneling-V11-02-01)
- Considerable updates;
- Semantic errors were corrected in G4BaierKatkov::RadIntegral and
  in G4VChannelingFastSimCrystalData::CoulombElectronScattering;
- New model of ionization losses for e+- has been implemented ionization
  G4VChannelingFastSimCrystalData with some updates in
  G4ChannelingFastSimModel and G4ChannelingFastSimCrystalData;
  some bugs concerning particles of higher charges were corrected;
- G4ChannelingFastSimCrystalData was updated to be compatible with
  new channeling dataset: G4CHANNELINGDATA. An option to use a custom
  input file was also added.
- Some new get functions were added.

## 2024-07-17 Vladimir Ivanchenko (fastsimchanneling-V11-02-00)
- G4VChannelingFastSimCrystalData - fixed Coverity warning

## 2023-10-23 Alexei Sytov (fastsimchanneling-V11-01-04)
- G4Log replaced std::log
- some small issues were fixed to comply with the Geant4 guidelines

## 2023-10-18 Alexei Sytov (fastsimchanneling-V11-01-03)
- Considerable updates:
- Revised version of the Baier-Katkov method with a new features of
  increasing of the photon statistics in certain intervals of spectrum;
  updates in defaults; some bugs were corrected
- The electromagnetic shower in W was simulated and preliminarly
  validated with experimental data from Eur. Phys. J. C 82, 699 (2022)
- Added the Crystalline Undulator (CU) as a periodically bent crystal 
  to the internal crystal geometry (still needs to be validated).

## 2023-06-15 Gabriele Cosmo (fastsimchanneling-V11-01-02)
- Fixed compilation warnings for implicit type conversions on macOS/XCode 14.1.

## 2023-06-08 Alexei Sytov (fastsimchanneling-V11-01-01)
- Fix Coverity defects

## 2023-05-17 Alexei Sytov (fastsimchanneling-V11-01-00)
- Created Channeling FastSimulation model and Baier Katkov method
