Contains processes for phonon propagation and interaction in materials.

G4LatticeManager:  Singleton (TLS) for logical and physical lattices
	associated with materials and volumes.

G4LatticeReader:  Driver to create logical lattices by reading in
	configuration files and velocity map tables.  NOTE:  This class will
	be moved to source/materials/ once Release 10.0 is deployed.

The lattice data files should be stored under $G4LATTICEDATA (set to
"./CrystalMaps" by default, to support the extended example).  The
configuration and velocity map files for a given material should be stored
in a subdirectory with that material's name (e.g., "Ge").

Documentation for the lattice configuration files will be expanded in the
future.

G4VPhononProcess:  Virtual base class for all processes below, providing
	some utility functions.

G4PhononDownconversion:  Process to convert single longitudinal phonons
	either into pairs of two transverse phonons, or to emit a transverse
	phonon.

G4PhononReflection:  Placeholder process to reflect phonons off of crystal
	surfaces.  Currently phonons are absorbed, or converted to hits.

G4PhononScattering:  Process to scatter phonons off the surrounding
	lattice.  Currently handles "transportation" as well, but each
	scatter destroys the phonon and creates a new one.

G4PhononPolarization:  Enum with conversion functions to map the three
	phonon particle definitions onto internal codes (L=0, TS=1, TF=2).

G4PhononTrackMap:  Singleton (TLS) map file to connect tracks with
	wavevectors.  for temporary use until wavevector is added to G4Track
	as a data member, after Release 10.0.
