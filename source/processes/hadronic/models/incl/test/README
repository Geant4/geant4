II REQUIREMENTS AND DEPENDENCIES

1. Geant4 9.1 was used for development.

2. ROOT (any version will do)

3. CERNLIB (for the reference FORTRAN code)

III BUILDING AND USING THE TESTS

0. If your Geant4 version is earlier than 9.1 you have to download
INCL/ABLA separately. Untar the tarball using command tar -zxf
<file> into directory $G4INSTALL/source/processes/hadronic/models

1. Build INCL4/ABLA by issuing command "make" in the incl/
-directory.

2. Setup CERNLIB settings, if necessary.

The default configuration is built for Debian GNU/Linux (and
Ubuntu). On different systems, however, the CERNLIB location and
library settings may differ. Especially the Debian and original CERN
versions of the library are slightly different. Both must be
supported.

The added configuration environment variables are:
CERNLIBDIR   -   The toplevel directory containing CERNLIB
The libraries needed are KERNLIB and PACKLIB. It is especially important to
note the difference between the libraries with and without libshift support.
KERNLIB      -   The name of the KERNLIB library
PACKLIB      -   The name of the PACKLIB library

Example (using Bash shell):
export CERNLIBDIR=/cern/pro
export KERNLIB=$CERNLIBDIR/lib/libkernlib_noshift.a
export PACKLIB=$CERNLIBDIR/lib/libpacklib_noshift.a

2. Enter the test/ directory and run command "make build".

3. You can do a test run by using "./run.sh <runID>". The runID's are
defined in runs.conf (use "cat runs.conf" to see them).

IV ANALYSING THE OUTPUT

There are three important things that must be considered when analysing
the output: TTree contents in the ROOT file, particle ID's used by
INCL and the normalization of results.

The ASCII data is converted using the program out2root into a root
file with one TTree object. The tree (called "h101") contains numbers
and arrays. Here is the list of variables in the tree:
Massini	        A of the remnant
Mzini	        Z    "        "
Exini	        Excit energy " "
Mulncasc	Cascade n multip.
Mulnevap	Evapo   "      "
Mulntot	        Total   "      "
Bimpact	        Impact parameter
Jremn	        Remnant Intrinsic Spin
Kfis	        Fission 1/0=Y/N
Estfis		Excit energy at fis
Izfis		Z of fiss nucleus
Iafis		A of "          "
Ntrack		Number of particles
Ityp[Ntrack]	emitted in cascade (1)
                or evapo   (0)
Avv[Ntrack]	A (-1 for pions)
Zvv[Ntrack]	Z
Enerj[Ntrack]	kinetic energy
Plab[Ntrack]	momentum
tetlab[Ntrack]	Theta (deg)
philab[Ntrack]	Phi   (deg)

The particles are identified using variables Avv and Zvv. The particle
codes are as follows:
Avv Zvv  Type
-1   -1   Pi-
-1   0    Pi0
-1   1    Pi+
1    1    Proton
1    0    Neutron
A    Z    Nucleus fragment (A > 1, Z >= 1), some examples below
2    1    Deuteron
3    1    Triton
4    3    He3
4    2    Alpha
208  82   Pb208

The normalization factor is calculated as follows:
f = geomCrossSection/(Events - transparentEvents)
All these numbers canbe found in the output.out.runSummary file where
the output.out is the ASCII file produced by the test driver. The
command to plot e.g. the outcoming particle type and isotope
distribution is as follows:
h101->Draw("Avv", "<insert normalization coefficient here>")
