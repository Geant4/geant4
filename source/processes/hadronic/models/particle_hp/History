--------------------------------------------------
Improvements made by Loic Thulliez and Eric Dumonteil (CEA Saclay):
- G4ParticleHPThermalScattering, G4ParticleHPElastic : corrected the
  original treatment of the temperature interpolation when computing
  the neutron final state, with the temperature interpolation performed
  stochastically now. 
- G4ParticleHPThermalScatteringNames : extended the list of materials
  which can have thermal data libraries.

22 October 2021 Alberto Ribon (hadr-hpp-V10-07-10)

  using the new version of G4PhysicsModelCatalog

23 May 2021 Dennis Wright (hadr-hpp-V10-07-08)
----------------------------------------------
- G4ParticleHPInelasticCompFS:::CompositeApply():
  in two places, replace line
     if (eExcitation < 20*CLHEP::keV) {eExcitation=0;}
   with  eExcitation = std::max(0.,QI[0] - QI[it]) 
  in order to implement fix of bug #2333

16 April 2021 Ben Morgan (hadr-hpp-V10-07-07)
--------------------------------------------------
- Migrate build to modular CMake API

03 May 2021 Vladimir Ivanchenko (hadr-hpp-V10-07-06)
--------------------------------------------------------
- G4ParticleHPData, G4ParticleHPJENDLHEData - G4LPhysicsFreeVector
    is substituted by G4PhysicsFreeVector

08 April 2021 Alberto Ribon (hadr-hpp-V10-07-05)
--------------------------------------------------------
- GNUmakefile, sources.cmake : removed the subdirectories
  hadronic/models/management and hadronic/models/util
  (that have been now deleted, with their classes moved to
   hadronic/util and hadronic/management).
  Removed also the useless dependency to hadronic/process.
  Clean-up of old directories no longer present.

08 April 2021 Alberto Ribon (hadr-hpp-V10-07-04)
--------------------------------------------------------
-  G4ParticleHPCaptureData, G4ParticleHPElasticData,
   G4ParticleHPFissionData, G4ParticleHPInelasticData,
   G4ParticleHPCaptureFS, G4ParticleHPFinalState,
   G4ParticleHPEnAngCorrelation, G4ParticleHPContAngularPar,
   G4ParticleHPMessenger : improved handling of UI commands, in particular
   between different runs, as well as in multi-threaded mode.

22 March 2021 Alberto Ribon (hadr-hpp-V10-07-03)
--------------------------------------------------------
-  G4ParticleHPManager : removed deprecated environmental variables.

18 March 2021 Alberto Ribon (hadr-hpp-V10-07-02)

05 November 2020 Alberto Ribon (hadr-hpp-V10-06-12)
--------------------------------------------------
-  G4ParticleHPInelastic, G4ParticleHPInelasticData : improved error message
   in the case that both G4PARTICLEHPDATA and the related particle-specific
   environmental variable (e.g. G4PROTONHPDATA) are not defined.
   The recommandation is to define only G4PARTICLEHPDATA.

27 October 2020 Alberto Ribon (hadr-hpp-V10-06-11)
--------------------------------------------------
-  G4ParticleHPInelastic, G4ParticleHPManager : enabled the print out of
   the physics parameters (only once and with a format similar to
   Precompound/de-excitation and RadioativeDecay; note that rather than
   enabling the print out in G4ParticleHPInelastic::BuildPhysicsTable,
   we could have used instead the analogous method BuildPhysicsTable of
   one of the following classes: G4ParticleHPCapture, G4ParticleHPElastic
   and G4ParticleHPFission).
-  G4ParticleHPContAngularPar, G4ParticleHPInelasticBaseFS,
   G4ParticleHPEnAngCorrelation, G4ParticleHPFinalState : replaced
   the use of the environmental variable G4PHP_DO_NOT_ADJUST_FINAL_STATE
   (the only one used outside the class G4ParticleHPManager - a part for
   the one pointing to the data libraries) with the equivalent
   G4ParticleHPManager::GetInstance()->GetDoNotAdjustFinalState().

05 August 2020 Alberto Ribon (hadr-hpp-V10-06-10)
-------------------------------------------------
- G4ParticleHPMessenger : added new UI macro command
  "use_Wendt_fission_model" related to the use of Wendt fission
  model; make sure that not more than one fission fragment model
  is active.
- G4ParticleHPManager : added a new variable related to the use of
  Wendt fission model; throw a "JustWarning" exception when the
  environmental variables are used (to remind that they are still
  valid but deprecated, and will be removed in Geant4 version 11.0);
  added new method "DumpSetting()" which needs to be called somewhere
  to print out once the values of its parameters.
- G4ParticleHPChannel : moved environmental variable related to
  the use of Wendt fission model from this class to
  G4ParticleHPManager.

21 July 2020 Ben Morgan (hadr-hpp-V10-06-09)
--------------------------------------------
- Use GEANT4_BUILD_PHP_AS_HP option to enable PHP_AS_HP,
  retiring use of PHP_AS_HP environment variable.

17 July 2020  Dennis Wright  (hadr-hpp-V10-06-08)
-------------------------------------------------
- Fix bug #2233: two fission fragment models can be active at the same time
  If Wendt model is active in ctor of G4ParticleHPChannel, turn off standard
  fragment production model

30 June 2020  Dennis Wright  (hadr-hpp-V10-06-07)
-------------------------------------------------
- Fix bug #2234: thread competition in method
  G4FissionProductYieldDist::G4GetFission(void).  Place auto lock
  on this method.

28 May 2020  Ben Morgan      (hadr-hpp-V10-06-06)
---------------------------------------------------
- Remove obsolete GRANULAR_DEPENDENCIES entries
- Use add_definitions to set PHP_AS_HP when required

19 May 2020  Alberto Ribon (hadr-hpp-V10-06-05)
-----------------------------------------------
- G4ParticleHPNames, G4ParticleHPProduct, G4ParticleHPInelastic,
  G4ParticleHPInelasticData, G4ParticleHPElasticData,
  G4ParticleHPCaptureData, G4ParticleHPFissionData : allowed the
  printout only if the global hadronic verbosity level is not zero.

05 May 2020   Gunter Folger  (hadr-hpp-V10-06-04)
-------------------------------------------------
- fix for clang10: Correct copy ctor in G4ParticleHPDataPoint.hh
   using default implementation

18 February 2020  Dennis Wright (hadr-hpp-V10-06-03)
----------------------------------------------------
- fix (from Artem Zontikov) bug 1838:
  G4ParticleHPInelasticBaseFS.cc,
    lines 412-413, 599-600: use QI[0]-QI[it] for excitation
    line 442: add particle definition protection to iLevel calculation

13 February 2020  Dennis Wright (hadr-hpp-V10-06-02)
----------------------------------------------------
- fix (from Artem Zontikov) bug 1824:
  change line 166 of G4ParticleHPInelasticBaseFS.cc to
  theFinalStatePhotons->InitPartials(theData, theXsection);

  change line 182 of G4ParticleHPInelasticCompFS.cc to
  theFinalStatePhotons[it]->InitPartials(theData, theXsection[50]);

  remove line delete [] theReactionXsec; in ~G4ParticleHPPhotonDist() as memory
  allocation does not take place in this class

17 January 2020  Alberto Ribon (hadr-hpp-V10-06-01)
----------------------------------------------------
- G4ParticleHPHash, G4ParticleHPCaptureFS : taken into account the difference
  between 'size_t' and 'G4int' to avoid warnings (seen on Windows).

15 January 2020  Dennis Wright (hadr-hpp-V10-06-00)
---------------------------------------------------
- G4ParticleHPThermalScvattering::create_E_isoAng_from_energy :
  add fatal exception for case when pointers panEPM_T_EL or panEPM_T_EH
  are null.  This fixes Coverity bugs 82418 and 82419.

 4 December 2019  Alberto Ribon (hadr-hpp-V10-05-09)
----------------------------------------------------
- G4ParticleHPContAngularPar : set protection against unphysical interpolation
  result in the method Sample.
- G4ParticleHPKallbachMannSyst : added the possibility of tritium and He3
  projectiles in the "A" method, taking in this case (arbitrarily) an
  intermediate value between the two already considered cases
  (proton-neutron-deuteron and alpha).
Note: these two fixes are needed to avoid crashes seen only with the physics
      list QGSP_BIC_AllHP. They should be checked and confirmed by experts.

24 October 2019  Alberto Ribon (hadr-hpp-V10-05-08)
---------------------------------------------------
-  G4ParticleHPNames : remove restriction of using isotopes with Z > 92
   (threfore removing the environmental variable AllowForHeavyElements).
   This was proposed by Emilio Mendoza and approved.

22 July 2019  Dennis Wright (hadr-hpp-V10-05-07)
------------------------------------------------
Two more corrections from Emilio:
- G4ParticleHPInelasticBaseFS::BaseApply(): re-calculation of Q value when
   no data in library
- G4ParticleHPNBodyPhaseSpace::Sample(): protection against maxE < 0

 5 July 2019  Dennis Wright (hadr-hpp-V10-05-06)
------------------------------------------------
Add Emilio Mendoza's improvements and bug fixes:
- G4ParticleHPChannel, G4ParticleHPNames: allow using an incomplete data
    library name if the environment variable G4NEUTRONHP_SKIP_MISSING_ISOTOPES
    is set.  The missing cross sections are then set to 0.
- G4ParticleHPContAngularPar: redefine residual mass to consider incident
    particles other than neutrons.
- G4ParticleHPInelasticBaseFS: add protection against residual with Z<0 or A<Z,
    do not apply adjust_final_state when data is in MF=6 format (no correlated
    particle emission),
    bug correction (add Q value info to G4ParticleHPNBodyPhaseSpace)
- G4ParticleHPInelasticCompFS: re-build method two_body_reaction() to be used by
    incident charged particles (now isotropic emission in the CMS).
    Also restrict nresp use below 20 MeV.
    Add photon emission when no data available.
- G4ParticleHPEnAngCorrelation: delete part of code trying to preserve baryon
    number - one has to assume that it is not preserved when using ENDF-6 data.
- G4ParticleHPKallbachMannSyst: bug fixes

25 June 2019  Dennis Wright (hadr-hpp-V10-05-05)
------------------------------------------------
- G4ParticleHPInelasticCompFS.cc : adopt fix of bug #2166 (A. Zontikov) to
  avoid arbitrary number of target nuclei being generated and slowing down
  multithreaded operation.

24 June 2019  Alberto Ribon (hadr-hpp-V10-05-04)
------------------------------------------------
- G4ParticleHPChannelList : fixed bug in the momentum change (it has to be
  a normalized 3-vector, but it was not) in the case that NeutronHP could
  not find a proper reaction channel. The bug was there since a while, but
  we started getting new warnings since G4 10.5.ref05, likely due to the
  change made on 8 May.

21 June 2019  Dennis Wright (hadr-hpp-V10-05-03)
------------------------------------------------
- fix of bug report 2167
  Adopted fix of Artem Zontikov to deal with un-incremented index of photons
  in G4ParticleHPPhotonDist::GetPhotons.  Also clean up dead code in that class.

8 May 2019  Dennis Wright (hadr-hpp-V10-05-02)
----------------------------------------------
- fix of bug report 1838
  Adopted fix of Artem Zontikov to deal with incorrect excitation energy
  when charged particles are emitted during neutron reaction
    G4ParticleHPInelasticCompFS.cc : method CompositeApply(), for very small
    excitation, change level index from -1 to 0 only if incident and outgoing
    particles are the same.


11 April 2019  Dennis Wright (hadr-hpp-V10-05-01)
-------------------------------------------------
- fix of bug report #1824
  Adopoted fix of Artem Zontikov to make sure production cross section is
  not ignored when sampling discrete gamma emission.
    G4ParticleHPPhotonDist.hh : added reaction cross section data member
    G4ParticleHPPhotonDist::GetPhotons() modified to statistically suppress
    gammas when reaction cross section is non-zero.
    G4ParticleHPPhotonDist::InitPartials() modified to take cross section
      argument
    G4ParticleHPInelasticBaseFS.cc and G4ParticleHPInelasticCompFS.cc
      modified to change calls to InitPartials to take cross section argument

6 February 2019  Alberto Ribon (hadr-hpp-V10-05-00)
---------------------------------------------------
- G4ParticleHPKallbachMannSyst::Kallbach : replaced G4Exp with std::exp in order
  to avoid underflow/overflow crashes observed with the physics list
  QGSP_BIC_AllHP in the version G4 10.5 .

26 November 2018  Gabriele Cosmo (hadr-hpp-V10-04-11)
-----------------------------------------------------
- Fixed potential leaks in G4ParticleHPPhotonDist, G4ParticleHPContAngularPar
  and G4ParticleHPFinalState for use of pointers cached in G4Cache.
- Minor code cleanup and formatting. Modified:
  G4VParticleHPEnergyAngular.hh, G4ParticleHPContAngularPar.hh.cc,
  G4ParticleHPAngular.hh, G4ParticleHPFinalState.hh.cc,
  G4ParticleHPFSFissionFS.hh, G4ParticleHPContEnergyAngular.hh,
  G4ParticleHPPhotonDist.hh, G4ParticleHPFissionBaseFS.hh,

- G4ParticleHPThermalScattering: fixed printout typo.

4 November 2018  Dennis Wright (hadr-hpp-V10-04-09)
---------------------------------------------------
- G4ParticleHPElasticFS::ApplyYourself(): use correct reference frames for
  calculation of projectile and target momenta.  Correction made for cases
  when cos(Theta) is given in lab frame and in center of momentum frame.
  Partial fix of momentum non-conservation bug report #1918.

22 October 2018  Dennis Wright (hadr-hpp-V10-04-08)
---------------------------------------------------
- G4ParticleHPCaptureFS::ApplyYourself(): Lorentz boost of neutron into target
  frane was backwards - reverse it.  Also replace SetDefinition() with
  SetDefinitionAndUpdateE() in line 75.  Fixes bug report #1919.

11 October 2018  Gabriele Cosmo (hadr-hpp-V10-04-07)
----------------------------------------------------
- Fixed definition of singletons for G4ParticleHPManager and
  G4ParticleHPThreadLocalManager and some code cleanup.
  Made G4ParticleHPThreadLocalManager a G4ThreadlLocalSingleton to avoid
  memory leaks generated each time a thread creates the instance.
- Fixed bug for double allocation of G4ParticleHPReactionWhiteBoard in
  G4ParticleHPThreadLocalManager::OpenReactionWhiteBoard().

4 September 2018  Dennis Wright (hadr-hpp-V10-04-06)

  Solves memory leaks in G4ParticleHPContEnergyAngular::Sample() and
  G4ParticleHPContAngularPar::cacheInit()

24 August 2018  Dennis Wright (hadr-hpp-V10-04-05)
--------------------------------------------------
- Fix bug 1789: gamma level mismatch in G4ParticleHPInelasticCompFS.cc
  Not a complete fix because gamma data comes from ENSDF and does not
  necessarily match excitations in ENDF.

24 August 2018  Dennis Wright (hadr-hpp-V10-04-04)
--------------------------------------------------
- Fix bug 1745: incorrect sampling of isotropic distribution in
