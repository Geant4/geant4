Description:
-----------

This directory contains a process-level test of inelastic hadron scattering using 
the LEP (Gheisha-style) inelastic scattering models.

p, n, lambda, sigma+, sigma-, xi0, xi- omega-, pbar, nbar, anti-lambda, anti-sigma+,
anti-sigma-, anti-xi0, anti-xi-, anti-omega-, pi+, pi-, K+, K-, K0L and K0S are
scattered from H, C, Fe and Pb and the secondaries are collected.

The output consists of the number of each type of secondary and the kinetic energy
averaged over the number of events.  The capability to histogram these quantities 
using ROOT also exists.


Running the test:
-----------------

Copy this directory to a test area and set the Geant4 environment and 
ROOT directories:

  source ../g4setup.env

Build the executable:

  gmake clean
  gmake

Run it:

  ../bin/$G4SYSTEM/hadroninelastic p Nevt

  where p is the proton momentum in GeV/c and Nevt is the number of 
  events to run.
