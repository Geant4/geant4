      -------------------------------------------------------------

This file should be used to summarize modifications introduced in the 
code and to keep track of all tags.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------
     * Please list in reverse chronological order (last date on top)
     ---------------------------------------------------------------

19-Nov-2019 A. Ribon         (had-hadronization-V10-05-04)
-  G4ExcitedStringDecay : protection in the sampling of resonance masses
   against values below threshold.
-  G4LundStringFragmentation, G4QGSMFragmentation : in the method SplitEandP,
   added a check that a string can be converted to an existing hadron 
   (else a null momentum is returned).

14-Nov-2019 A. Ribon         (had-hadronization-V10-05-03)
-  G4VLongitudinalStringDecay : forgotten initialization of c-cbar and b-bbar
   pair production for kinks or gluons. 

07-Nov-2019 A. Ribon         (had-hadronization-V10-05-02)
-  Implementation, made by Vladimir Uzhinsky, of the fragmentation functions
   of heavy (charm and bottom) quarks and diquarks for the QGS string
   fragmentation, based on a review of the available theoretical papers.
-  The same set of mixing meson parameters (for both scalar and vector
   mesons), as defined in the base class G4VLongitudinalStringDecay, are
   now used on both FTF and QGS.
-  Minor changes and clean-up for the Lund string fragmentation.

06-Nov-2019 A. Ribon         (had-hadronization-V10-05-01)
-  Correction by Vladimir Uzhinsky in the Lund string fragmentation regarding
   the search for final-state in the last string decay.
   Note: this bug was responsible of both the bad hadronic showers and the
         slow CPU performances observed in 10.5.ref10.
-  Switch off the probability of charm and bottom hadron production
   in both Lund and QGS string fragmentations.
   Note: this is a temporary protection, to be removed after the release.

09-Oct-2019 A. Ribon         (had-hadronization-V10-05-00)
-  Extension, made by Vladimir Uzhinsky, of both Lund and QGS string
   fragmentation to allow the possibility to have charm and/or bottom quarks
   and diquarks in the strings. As a result of the hadronization of strings
   having heavy (c, b) quarks, charmed and bottom hadrons can be produced:
   only heavy mesons and baryons that can fly macroscopic distances are
   considered as candidate final states.
   (Note: this extension has required also to extend the list of diquarks
          available in Geant4, to add those made with charm and bottom quarks
          in the method G4ShortLivedConstructor::ConstructQuarks.)
-  Unused class G4VKinkyStringDecay has been removed.

20-Nov-2018 A. Ribon         (had-hadronization-V10-04-07)

26-Oct-2018 V. Uzhinsky      (had-hadronization-V10-04-05)
-  G4LundStringFragmentation : tuning of strange - anti-strange probability
   production as a function of energy to describe NA61/SHINE 31 GeV/c p-C 
   data on K+ / K- production. Decreased also the Lambda0 production for 
   NA61/SHINE 158 GeV/c and 31 GeV/c p-C : for the former good agreement,
   while for the latter the simulation underestimates the data.
-  G4QGSMFragmentation : new algorithm for last string decay a-la Lund
   is implemented. Improved the algorithm to stop the fragmentation.
   Tuning of parameters with NA49 and NA61/SHINE data was performed.

04-Oct-2018 A. Ribon         (had-hadronization-V10-04-04)
-  Coverity fix and general clean-up: no changes in the physics, nor
   to the random sequence.

18-Jan-2018 A. Ribon         (had-hadronization-V10-04-03)
-  G4VLongitudinalStringDecay : removed useless caching in the method

-  Brought back the development version of hadronization 
   (as it was in had-hadronization-V10-03-07).

27-Oct-2017 A. Ribon         (had-hadronization-V10-03-09)
-  G4ExcitedStringDecay : introduced smearing of resonance masses
   (as requested by the PANDA Collaboration).
-  G4LundStringFragmentation : a dependence of <Pt> on S is introduced
   only for AntiP P annihilations.

26-Oct-2017 A. Ribon         (had-hadronization-V10-03-08)
-  Brought back the stable, production hadronization (as in 10.3 and 10.2).

24-Oct-2017 V. Uzhinsky      (had-hadronization-V10-03-07)
-  A dependence of <Pt> on S is introduced for AntiP P annihilations.

                  G4FragmentingString.hh
                  G4LongitudinalStringDecay.hh
   Parameters are tuned using NA49 exp. data on pp-interactions.
   Good results are obtained for Pi+-, K+-. For P and Pbar <Pt> - xF
   correlations are not quite well.

13-Jan-2017 V. Uzhinsky      (had-hadronization-V10-03-03)
-  Re-organized and cleaned G4LUNDStringFragmentatio.
   The variant is tuned using NA49 exp. data on pp->p/pi/K +X. 

14-Dec-2016 A. Ribon         (had-hadronization-V10-03-02)
-  After the release G4 10.3, with "stable" version, this tag brings back
   the "development" version, similar (although not identical because
   of some code clean-up and the (internal) tag had-hadronization-V10-03-00,
   see below) to G4 10.2.ref10.
   (Please note that the changes in G4LundStringFragmentation.cc of the
   (internal) tag had-hadronization-V10-03-01 have been excluded in the
   present tag, in order to test one change at the time.)

30-Nov-2016 V. Uzhinsky      (had-hadronization-V10-03-01)
   G4LundStringFragmentation.cc - Mt distribution for produced hadrons
   was introduced.

 9-Nov-2016 A. Ribon         (had-hadronization-V10-03-00)

   Created tag on branch of 10.2.ref07 to fix a bug on the method
   G4ExcitedStringDecay::FragmentStrings .
   Note that this bug has been already fixed in the trunk.

20-July-2016 A. Ribon        (had-hadronization-V10-02-12)
   G4LundStringFragmentation: V.U. erased the warring messages from
   the previous tag.

   G4LundStringFragmentation: Method SetMinimalStringMass was essential improved.
   Energy-momentum conservation was restored for processes with Delta-isobar
   production.

30-June-2016 V. Uzhinsky     (had-hadronization-V10-02-10)
   One more misprint was found in G3LundStringFragmentaion.cc
   MinStringMass method.

29-June-2016 V. Uzhinsky     (had-hadronization-V10-02-09)
   Alberto found a misstype in the previous G3LundStringFragmentaion.cc
   The tag will be redone.

29-June-2016 V. Uzhinsky     (had-hadronization-V10-02-08)
   The method of G4VLongitudinalStringDecay::Splitup was transferd to FTF
   and QGS model because now the treat differently Delta isobars.

27-June-2016 V. Uzhinsky     (had-hadronization-V10-02-07)
   G4LundStringFragmentation.cc algorithm was improved.
   Fragmentation is made a'la LUND fragmentation.

13-June-2016 V. Uzhinsky     (had-hadronization-V10-02-06)
   G4LundStringFragmentation::Sample4Momentum() was improved.
   Average transvers momentum is set to 475 MeV for mesons and baryons,
   and <Pt> for barion 3/2 production - 800 MeV/c. 

   G4LundStringFragmentation::GetLightConeZ - alund=0.233 GeV^2 for strange
   meson produced by a quark, and alund=0.175 GeV^2 for q->baryon.

   di-quark fragmentation function into baryon (1/2) z^1.5, and z^(-0.25)
   for baryon (3/2). 
   Note: the tag was made accidentally in the wrong directory (src/).

 6-June-2016 V. Uzhinsky     (had-hadronization-V10-02-05)
   Re-tag of previouse tag. Compilation warning is erased.

 4-June-2016 V. Uzhinsky     (had-hadronization-V10-02-04)
   A solution of the baryon puzzle of NA49 data has been found! <Pt>
   of baryons 1/2 at a string fragmentation is setting up at 435 MeV/c,
   and <Pt> for barion 3/2 production - 900 MeV/c.

 1-June-2016 V. Uzhinsky     (had-hadronization-V10-02-03)
   Fine tuning of G4LundStringFragmentation.cc. <Pt> of mesons created at 
   quark fragmentation is decreased. <Pt> of baryons created at quark and
   diquark is increased. Fragmentation functions of qq-> B(1/2) and B(3/2)
   are implemented correctly.

28-May-2016 V. Uzhinsky      (had-hadronization-V10-02-02)
   <Pt^2> is increased in 2 times in G4LundStringFragmentation.cc.
   It is very important for a description of NA49 exp. data on
   pp-interactions at 158 GeV/c, especially for xF and Pt distributions.

23-May-2016 V. Uzhinsky      (had-hadronization-V10-02-01)
   Di-quark fragmentation into baryons is improved in LUND
   string fragmentation. Description of NA49 and NA61/SHINE

 - G4QGSMFragmentation, G4FragmentingString : Coverity fix.

 7-Aug-2015 A. Ribon      (had-hadronization-V10-01-08)
 - G4LundStringFragmentation, G4QGSMFragmentation, G4ExcitedStringDecay
   and G4VKinkyStringDecay : checking of 'while' loops.

 5-Aug-2015 A. Ribon      (had-hadronization-V10-01-07)
 - G4VLongitudinalStringDecay, G4LundStringFragmentation, G4QGSMFragmentation:
   replaced std::exp, std::log and std::pow with the faster 
   G4Exp, G4Log and G4Pow, respectively.
   This changes the random number sequence.

 5-June-2015 V. Uzhinsky  (had-hadronization-V10-01-06)
 - A mistake was erased in G4QGSMFragmentation::SplitEandP.
   FragmentationMass(NewString,&G4HadronBuilder::BuildLowSpin) ->
   FragmentationMass(NewString,&G4HadronBuilder::Build)!

 4-June-2015 V. Uzhinsky  (had-hadronization-V10-01-05)
 - G4QGSMFragmentation::SplitEandP a bug is fixed which led to energy-momentum
   non-conservation quite rare. 
   FragmentationMass(NewString,&G4HadronBuilder::BuildHighSpin);
   was changed into 
   FragmentationMass(NewString,&G4HadronBuilder::BuildLowSpin);
   See Uzhi 03.06.2014

 2-June-2015 V. Uzhinsky  (had-hadronization-V10-01-04)
 - G4ExcitedStringDecay.cc - a very serious bug was found. It led
   to energy-momentum non-conservation at QGSM application.
   I am afraid that it can have influence on FTF model hadronization.

29-May-2015 V. Uzhinsky   (had-hadronization-V10-01-03)
 - G4LundStringFragmentation - a bug led to FPE is erased. It was in
           G4LundStringFragmentation::FragmentString -- 
         if(!IsFragmentable(&aString)) // produce 1 hadron 
   was applied to qq- anti_qq string with mass 1951 MeV, and there was an attempt
   to produce 2 baryons without of a checking baryon masses. I am afraid
                 that it was presented before.
   Now it is: if(!aString.FourQuarkString() && !IsFragmentable(&aString)).

25-May-2015 V. Uzhinsky   (had-hadronization-V10-01-02)
 - G4LundStringFragmentation - Parameters are tuned for a description of NA49 data.

26-Mar-2015 A. Ribon      (had-hadronization-V10-01-01)
 - G4LundStringFragmentation - changes introduced by V. Uzhinsky to improve
   the reaction cross sections of: Pbar + P -> Pi+Pi-, K+K-

21-Jan-2015 A. Ribon      (had-hadronization-V10-01-00)

   "if(StringMass >= ...)" with "if(StringMass > ...)" in three places.

28-Nov-2014 V. Uzhinsky   (had-hadronization-V10-00-13)
 - G4LundStringFragmentation - charged baryon number conservation is fixed
   for K-nucleus interactions 

6-Nov-2014 V. Uzhinsky    (had-hadronization-V10-00-12)
 - Warning message is erased.

5-Nov-2014 V. Uzhinsky    (had-hadronization-V10-00-11)
 - Redoing tag had-hadronization-V10-00-10 because it was done in src directory
   instead of top directory - hadronization.

3-Nov-2014 V. Uzhinsky    (had-hadronization-V10-00-10)
- G4ExcitedStringDecay.cc Restoration of the initial string system is addded 
  for a correct repeatition of calculations in the case when hadronization is fault.

- G4LundStringFragmentation.cc Fragmentation functions for qq -> B are set as 
  f(z)~ Const for all baryons.

20-Oct-2014 A.Ribon        (had-hadronization-V10-00-09) 
- G4VLongitudinalStringDecay.cc : mixing between the vector mesons
  rho0 and omega have been changed from 50% (rho0) - 50% (omega) to
  100% (rho0) - 0% (omega), in order to reduce the pi0 production. 
  Expected little effects in thin-target, and significant effects
  in hadronic showers in calorimeters.

15-Oct-2014 V.Uzhinsky     (had-hadronization-V10-00-08)
- Essential improvement of QGS hadronization.
  Fragmentation functions of quarks and di-quarks are closed to Kaidalov's
  and Shabelskii's ones. G4QGSMFragmentation::GetLightConeZ was almost
  re-written. Ionk algorithm is inserted for sampling light-cone momentum
  fraction, z. Parameters of the fragmentation were tuned. They will be
  improved after a revision of the QGSM string creation algorithm.
- The algorith of G4QGSMFragmentation::SplitEandP was improved. It is 
  faster now.

29-Sep-2014, V.Uzhinsky    (had-hadronization-V10-00-07)
- Essential improvement of hadronization.
- Parameters and string fragmentation functions of 
  G4LundStringFragmentation.cc were tuned, assuming that the weight of
  uu-diquarks in protons is 1/6.
- Threatment of string decay direction was improved in G4FragmentingString.cc
  and G4LundStringFragmentation.cc
- EnergyAndMomentumCorrector was improved in G4ExcitedStringDecay.cc
- The method DiQuarkSplitUp in G4VLongitudinalStringDecay.cc is turned to
  virtual, and the corresponding methods were introduced in
  G4LundStringFragmentation.cc and G4QGSMFragmentation.cc
- Debugging possibilities are improved.

04-Jul-2014, A.Ribon       (had-hadronization-V10-00-06)
- G4LundStringFragmentation.cc : brought back the Sample4Momentum method
  as it was before to avoid crashes.

02-Jul-2014, A.Ribon       (had-hadronization-V10-00-05)
- G4ExcitedStringDecay.cc and G4LundStringFragmentation.cc : minor clean-up
  of the previous, internal two tags, and propose for testing.

30-May-2014, V.Uzhinsky    (had-hadronization-V10-00-04)
- Bug is fixed in G4LundStringFragmentation.cc for anti-diquark-diquark strings.
- Anisotropic decay is only left in G4LundStringFragmentation::Sample4Momentum for
  a sampling of momenta of 2 last produced hadrons for all strings. Before this,
  quark-diquark strings were decayed isotropically. It is improve a little bit 
  proton spectra.

25-May-2014, V. Uzhinsky   (had-hadronization-V10-00-03)
- Parameters of G4LundStringFragmentation.cc were re-tuned.

  ">=" with ">" in three if statements, which caused crashes in the
  case of anti_sigma+ capture at rest on hydrogen.

14-Nov-2013, A.Ribon       (had-hadronization-V09-06-02)
- Fixed two mistakes in the index manipulation of the BaryonWeight

3 Nov 2010, Gunter Folger               (had-hadronization-V09-03-02)
- fix minor coverity warnings in G4HadronBuilder 

22-September-2010  V. Uzhinsky          (had-hadronization-V09-03-01)
--------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------
- Small re-organization is done in G4ExcitedStringDecay.hh. Inline
  methods were moved to G4ExcitedStringDecay.cc.

- An action is introduced in FragmentStrings. It acts when 
  EnergyAndMomentumCorrector can not be done due to large sum masses
  of produced hadrons. This led to energy-momentum violation. Now
  string fragmentation is repeted 100 times in a bad case.

21-June-2010  V. Uzhinsky               (had-hadronization-V09-03-00)

--------------------------------------------------------------
- Bug was fixed in G4VLongitudinalStringDecay.cc at calculation of
  formation/creation time, c_light was inserted.
- String tension parameter was set to the usual value (1 GeV/fm) in
  G4LundStringFragmentation.cc

--------------------------------------------------------------
- remove temporary workaround - fix is now in QGS
- change pt sampling in G4LundStringFragmentation to avoid near endless
  loop; this should improve overall performance slightly.
  Affected G4VLongitudinalStringDecay, where SampleQuarkPt() is 
  implemented; affected .hh and .cc for new optional argument of max Pt 
  to SampleQuarkPt()

---------------------------------------------------------------------
- reset formatting changes by MK with tags hadr-prtn-hadr-V09-02-xx
- temporary workaround for wrong PDG codes created on wrong input from QGS 
  when used for e.g. antiproton.

- Seperate FTF and QGS fragmentation dir methods where V.Uzhinsky
  modified the algorithm for FTF.

- G4ExcitedStringDecay::EnergyAndMomentumCorrector no longer causes Exception 
  when no converging. Add more info when failing. Return correct status.

--------------------------------------------------------------
- G4ExcitedStringDecay::EnergyAndMomentumCorrector :
  Correct bug which did stop correction even if not yet converged;
  check on convergence must check that scale-1 is close to 0,
  and not less than 0

26-May 2006 Gunter Folger
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix ( finally?) the charge check in G4HadronBuilder.cc
