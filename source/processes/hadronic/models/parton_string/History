07 December 2016,  A. Ribon (hadr-prtn-stable-V10-02-06/hadr-prtn-V10-02-03)
   G4FTFParameter : set SetExcitationEnergyPerWoundedNucleon to 40 MeV.

--------------------------------------------------
01 December 2016,  A. Ribon (hadr-prtn-stable-V10-02-05/hadr-prtn-V10-02-02)
   G4FTFParameter : changed SetExcitationEnergyPerWoundedNucleon 
   from 100 MeV (as in G4 10.1) to 80 MeV (it was 40 MeV in G4 10.2).

--------------------------------------------------
09 November 2016,  A. Ribon (hadr-prtn-stable-V10-02-04/hadr-prtn-V10-02-01)
   G4ExcitedStringDecay : increased the number of max attempts to
   fragment strings from 10 to 100.

--------------------------------------------------
12 October 2016,  A. Ribon (hadr-prtn-stable-V10-02-03/hadr-prtn-V10-02-00)
   G4VPartonStringModel : instead of having the string creation loop
   (with max 20 attempts) and the string fragmentation loop (with max
   100 attempts) separated, there is now one single loop for string
   creation and fragmentation, with max 1000 attempts, and in the case
   of failure a just-warning exception is thrown.

--------------------------------------------------
11 October 2016,  A. Ribon (hadr-prtn-stable-V10-02-02)
   G4FTFModel : brought back completely, as in G4 10.1, the treatment
   of the residual nucleus excitation energy (there were a few places
   which were forgotten in the tag cms_hadr-string-diff-V10-01-17).

--------------------------------------------------
11 October 2016,  A. Ribon (hadr-prtn-stable-V10-02-01)
   First clean-up and identation of the code.
   No changes of the random number sequence.

--------------------------------------------------
06 October 2016,  A. Ribon (hadr-prtn-stable-V10-02-00)
   Created first (internal) tag of the stable parton_string branch.
   This corresponds to parton_string as in G4 10.2.p02 , with the special
   (internal) tag cms_hadr-string-diff-V10-01-17 on top of diffraction,
   in order to bring the residual nucleus excitation energy as it was in
   G4 10.1 .
   The aim of this stable parton_string branch is to produce hadronic
   showers, with either FTF or QGS string models, very similar to those
   in G4 10.1, which are reasonably good for the LHC experiments.

==================================================

--------------------------------------------------
26 March 2014,  G.Folger (hadr-prtn-V10-00-02)

   Improvement of FTF model:
   A Status of nuclear nucleon involved in an interaction is introdused.
   Status: 0 - spectator, 1 - involved nucleon, 2 - absorbed nucleon
   (G4VSplitableHadron)

   A connection between a participant nucleon and a nuclear nucleon was
   introsuced in G4InteractionContent.

   All of these allow to improve FTF model for pion obsorption on nuclei.
   These required a lot of changes in FTF.

-------------------------------------------------
9 July 2009 V. Uzhinsky (hadr-prtn-V09-01-03)
  Charge-exchange was implemented for pn->np in elastic and inelastic 
  interactions simulated by FTF. Pion absorption by a nucleon was 
  implemented also. tag - hadr-string-diff-V09-02-02 

  Bug was fixed in G4VLongitudinalStringDecay.cc at calculation of
  formation/creation time, c_light was inserted. Due to this string 
  tension parameter was set to the usual value (1 GeV/fm) in
  G4LundStringFragmentation.cc. tag - had-hadronization-V09-02-02

  New field was added in G4VSplitableHadron class (G4 bool Activation)
  and corresponding methods to operatite with it. It was needed for an 
  absorption of meson in nuclear collision generated by FTF.

-----------------------------------------------

23 June 2008 V. Uzhinsky (hadr-prtn-V09-01-02)
   G4QGSMFragmentation.cc and G4LundStringFragmentation.cc were
   decoupled at calculation of formation time due to adding methods
   and member in G4VLongitudinalStringDecay class for manipulation
   with string tension.

   Memory leak was erased in G4QGSMFragmentation.cc and 
   G4VLongitudinalStringDecay.cc thank to Gunter.
