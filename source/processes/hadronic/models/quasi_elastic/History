# History entries prior to 11.0

13-Jul-2021, A. Ribon hadr-qelastic-V10-07-02
- G4QuasiElRatios : initialize the logarithmic table lastLRatio,
  as suggested by Coverity.

16-Apr-2021, B. Morgan hadr-qelastic-V10-07-01
- Migrate build to modular CMake API

13-Apr-2021, A.Ribon hadr-qelastic-V10-07-00
- GNUmakefile, sources.cmake : removed the subdirectories
  hadronic/models/management and hadronic/models/util
  (that have been now deleted, with their classes moved to
   hadronic/util and hadronic/management).
  Removed also the useless dependency to hadronic/process.

24-Jul-2020, A.Ribon hadr-qelastic-V10-06-01
- G4QuasiElRatios : extended to charmed and bottom hadrons.
  (The simplified treatment adopted here is the following:
   to treat all heavy mesons having constituent charm or bottom quark
   as a meson with strange quark - like K- - and all heavy mesons
   having constituent anti-charm or anti-bottom anti-quark as a
   meson with anti-strange quark - like K+;
   for baryons, all heavy baryons are treated as Lambda and all heavy
   anti-baryons are treated as anti-proton/anti-neutron.
   Only two methods have been changed: G4QuasiElRatios::GetElTotXS and
   G4QuasiElRatios::FetchElTot, whereas G4QuasiElRatios::ChExer does
   not need to be changed because it is not used anywhere.)

10-Mar-2020, V.Ivanchenko hadr-qelastic-V10-06-00
- G4QuasiElRatios : fixed memory leak at exit

24-Apr-2018, A.Ribon hadr-qelastic-V10-04-00
- G4QuasiElRatios : removed unnecessary protection against heavy elements.

20-Apr-2016, G.Cosmo hadr-qelastic-V10-02-00
- Fixed shadowing compilation warnings in G4QuasiElRatios for 'ps'.

01-Nov-2015, W.Pokorski hadr-qelastic-V10-01-03

  constants, in plan to remove implicit inclusion from globals.hh.

04-Oct-2011, W.Pokorski
- This new directory contains now the quasi-elastic process that have been extracted from CHIPS.
  It is used by all the physics lists and it has been made independent from CHIPS.
