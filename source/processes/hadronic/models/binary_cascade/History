30 August, V. Uzhinsky   -- Proposed changes in bin.cascade to protect

                            combination.
  They are:

  1. Shift of particle's formation times that the min. time=0.

  2. Including of captured particles (Due to absence of the options there 
     were a large energy-non-conservation).

  3. GetExcitationEnergy() - correction for the case when all nucleons are
     ejected.

  4. Correction for the nuclear field for baryons.
