15-Oct-2019, Alberto Ribon          had-binary-V10-05-00
- G4GeneratorPrecompoundInterface: extended by Vladimir Uzhinsky to
  include a simple coalescence model for nucleus-nucleus interactions
  (in the interface between string and precompound models).
  This allows to improve the nucleon spectra and produce fast deuterons
  in ion-ion collisions.

    BLIR not yet.  

9-September 2015, Gunter Folger      had-binary-V10-01-08
- migrate to G4Exp, G4Log, and G4Pow for std::exp, std::log, and std::pow.

       fragments are transformed to Lab. system.

11-November 2014 Gunter Folger    had-binary-V10-00-11
- BinaryLightReaction: Momentum correction wrong in case of no Fragment, but 
       primary projectile nucleon(s) in final state.

4-November 2014 Gunter Folger    had-binary-V10-00-10
- remove left over use of SetA/SetZ.

	 energy and momentum, taking into account momentum transfered to nucleus,
	  and finally forcing conservation.	 
- BinaryLightIonreaction: handle currentA/Z consistant with list of spectators.
    added optional debugging output.

30 August, V. Uzhinsky   -- Proposed changes in bin.cascade to protect

                            combination.
  They are:

  1. Shift of particle's formation times that the min. time=0.

  2. Including of captured particles (Due to absence of the options there 
     were a large energy-non-conservation).

  3. GetExcitationEnergy() - correction for the case when all nucleons are
     ejected.

  4. Correction for the nuclear field for baryons.
