06 February 07: V.Ivanchenko (emstand-V08-02-04)
- G4UrbanMscModel - L.Urban : fix in the single scattering code for heavy
                              particles, now the code can be used with
                              skin=1 e+/e- and for heavy particles as well.

- G4MultipleScattering - allow reinicialisation of model parameters between runs

20 Nov 06: V.Ivanchenko (emstand-V08-01-14)
20 Nov 06:

  now there is single scattering just before boundary crossings (and not
  inside a volume)    

15 Nov 06: V.Ivanchenko (emstand-V08-01-13)
- G4UrbanMscModel - fix NaN inside SampleCosineTheta (L.Urban)

10 Nov 06: V.Ivanchenko (emstand-V08-01-12)
07 Nov 06:
- G4UrbanMscModel - some optimization in ComputeTruePathLengthLimit,
  fixes in ComputeGeomPathLength, SampleCosineTheta (L.Urban)

31 Oct 06: V.Ivanchenko (emstand-V08-01-11)
- G4UrbanMscModel is changed to work with new approach of parallel
                  navigation (j.Apostolakis)

26 Oct 06: V.Ivanchenko (emstand-V08-01-10)
- G4hMultipleScattering - new class configured for hadrons
- G4eCoulombScatteringModel - set cross section const below 1 keV

23 Oct 06: V.Ivanchenko (emstand-V08-01-09)
- G4BraggIonModel - reduce lowest energy for parameterisation to 0.25 keV
23 Oct 06: L.Urban
- G4MultipleScattering - parameter skin = 1 by default,
- G4UrbanMscModel - more effective safety update in SampleSecondaries,
  + come cosmetics.

20 Oct 06: V.Ivanchenko (emstand-V08-01-08)
- G4CoulombScatteringModel inherit from G4eCoulombScatteringModel,
  screening parameter computation is done in inline function 
- G4eeToTwoGammaModel - introduce member theGamma 

20 Oct 06: L.Urban cleanup of msc
- theta0 parameter for SampleCosineTheta is computed in a public 
  function ComputeTheta0;
- default value of skin = 0 (there is no small step with single scattering if
  skin <=0, and there are ~skin small steps if skin >0
- no z sampling in ComputeGeomPathLength by default
- correction in the single scattering part, allowing not only small angles now
- PostStep ComputeSafety(pos) is used

16 Oct 06: V.Ivanchenko (emstand-V08-01-07)
- Add extra protection to G4eplusAnnihilation52 
- Add warning to all processes 52 and 71 type 

16 Oct 06: L.Urban 
- new msc version (G4MultipleScattering, G4UrbanMscModel):
  -  Stepping has been modified:
     -  min. steplimit in 8.1: tlimitmin = max(lambda/25, 5 nanometer)
                  now        : tlimitmin = max(lambda/25, 1.01*stepmin)
           where stepmin ~ lambda elastic

     - possibility to have extreme small step(s) before boundary crossing
       this feature is not active by default;
       it can be activated by setting the data member "skin" to a
       non-negative value, steplimit = stepmin, if the distance to the boundary
       (in the original direction) is smaller than skin*stepmin;

     - the step restriction is weaker for particles with higher energy,
       i.e. bigger effective facrange value is used in this case
       in 8.0/8.1 this 'scaling' depends on Tkin, new version : 
       scaling depends on lambda, giving smaller material dependence

  - Angular distribution has been changed:

     - single/plural scattering for step <= stepmin
       (in this case t = z + no lateral displacement)

     - parameter theta0 has been (sligtly) modified

     - tail of the distribution has been modified, now the parameter 
       describing the tail is material (i.e. Z) dependent
