May 30th, 2011 Alex Howard (procbiasing-V09-04-00)
- G4ProcessPlacer: Using SetProcessOrderingToSecond for biasing process, and 
leaving transportation where it is (hopefully first). Previously biasing was 
moved first, then transportation moved back to first.

June 2nd, 2010 Gabriele Cosmo (procbiasing-V09-03-00)
- G4WeightWindowProcess: corrected call to G4WeightWindowStore::GetLowerWeight()
  after correction of mispelling in name...
- Requires tag geombias-V09-03-00.

April 22nd, 2008 Alex Howard (procbiasing-V09-01-02)
- Removed G4CellFinder and associated dependency in G4WeigthCutOffProcess and 
  G4WeightCutOffConfigurator- was a hang-up from previous implementation 
  which was erroneously left in the G4WeightCutOffProcess.
  This meant the WeightCutOff could only work in a MASS geometry 
  (by coincidence between the ImportanceBiasing and the GeometryCells).

April 21st, 2008 Alex Howard (procbiasing-V09-01-01)
- mis-tagged - please ignore

April 21st, 2008 Alex Howard (procbiasing-V09-01-00)
- Tag of the HEAD which includes scoring for backwards compatibility

October 31st, 2007 Alex Howard (procbiasing-V09-00-00)
- Fixed G4ProcessPlacer.cc to put biasing process second for AlongStep
  as well as PostStep - a bug which would feature for charged particles.
- Added print out for AlongStep process vector to avoid confusion

June 22nd, 2007 Alex Howard (procbiasing-V08-03-08)
- Added missing member function to G4VSampler base class

June 12th, 2007 Alex Howard (procbiasing-V08-03-05)

- Added missing source file G4VProcessPlacer.cc previously resident in
  processes/transportation
- Removed scoring inheritance in G4VSampler
- HEAD maintains inheritance for backward comparisons/testing

June 1st, 2007 Alex Howard (procbiasing-V08-03-03)
- Renamed New classes back to normal classes, simultaneously 
  processes/transportation old biasing classes renamed with 
  suffix 8 to avoid clashes.
- includes modified G4GeometrySampler (without scoring)
- HEAD contains un-modifier G4GeometrySampler and depends on old scoring scheme
  in geometry/biasing.

May 31st, 2007 Alex Howard (procbiasing-V08-03-02)
- removed dependency on old biasing within transportation and on old scoring
  within geometry

  biasing scoring for the purpose of testing

- added missing includes to GNUmakefile

May 30th, 2007 Alex Howard (procbiasing-V08-03-00)
- migrated classes and tests from processes/scoring

May 25th, 2007 Jane Tinslay
- Add tests for physics biasing under test/physics_biasing
