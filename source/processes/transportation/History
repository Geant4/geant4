-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2023-01-25 John Apostolakis (transport-V11-00-11)
- Fix unwanted change of default looper parameters.
  ( Reversed inadvertent creation of G4TransportationParameters in
    calls to G4Transportation constructor.)

## 2023-01-09 Jonas Hahnfeld
- Fix compilation warning about unused variable without `G4VERBOSE`.

## 2022-11-25 Gabriele Cosmo (transport-V11-00-10)
- Removed debug printouts in G4Transportation.

## 2022-11-23 Gabriele Cosmo (transport-V11-00-09)
- Fixed compilation warnings for implicit type conversions on macOS/XCode 14.1.

## 2022-11-10 John Apostolakis (transport-V11-00-08)
- New class G4TransporationParameters to hold looper parameters & others.
  This is a class to be created in master and hold the values of all looper 
  parameters for G4Transportation and derived classes.
  * G4Transporation's  constructor checks for the existence of a default 
    instance. If found, its values will be assigned to the corresponding
    data members of G4Transporation.
    This behaviour is inherited by subclasses (using this constructor).
  * The (default) 'instance' of G4TransportationParameters should be
    shared by all threads, and used for all particle types.
    These values could be subsequently changed - e.g. in User Actions.
  * The G4TransporationParameters object (instance) is current unique.
    ( Future extensions are envisioned that allow an object of this  
      to be associated with a separate instance of G4Transportation assigned 
      to one or more particle types, e.g. electrons, or muons and positrons. )

## 2022-10-05 Gabriele Cosmo (transport-V11-00-07)
- Fixed compilation warnings on Intel/icx compiler for variables set
  but not used.

## 2022-05-18 Gabriele Cosmo (transport-V11-00-06)
- `G4Transportation`, `G4CoupledTransportation`: fixed misuse of bitwise '|'
  operator instead of logical.

## 2022-05-11 Jonas Hahnfeld (transport-V11-00-05)
- `G4Transportation`: Remove non-working check for any field
- Remove `PUBLIC` dependency on `G4magneticfield`, `G4navigation`

## 2022-04-24 Vladimir Ivanchenko (transport-V11-00-04)
- moved G4UserSpecialCuts to physics_lists/constructors/limiters
- GNUmakefile, source.cmake - removed dependence on electromagnetic/utils 

## 2022-04-20 Jonas Hahnfeld (transport-V11-00-03)

# History entries prior to 11.0

Sep 23rd 2021, Alberto Ribon transport-V10-07-03
----------------------------
- Added PARALLEL_WORLD_PROCESS to G4TransportationProcessType
  (to avoid hardwired value "491" in the constructor of class
   G4ParallelWorldProcess).

Apr 16th 2021, Ben Morgan transport-V10-07-02
-------------------------
- Migrate build to modular CMake API

Feb 24th 2021, G. Cosmo transport-V10-07-01
-----------------------
- Enable setting of smooth curved trajectories to particle-change in
  G4CoupledTransportation::AlongStepDoIt(), which was commented out by
  mistake. Based on discussion in Geant4 Forum thread #4271.

Dec 16th 2020, G. Amadio transport-V10-07-00
------------------------
- Limit reporting of number of calls to G4Transportation::AlongStepDoIt()
  to when either G4VERBOSE or G4DEBUG_TRANSPORT is defined, which allows to
  avoid using a thread local variable for a slight performance gain.

Oct 26th 2020, G. Amadio & J.Apostolakis transport-V10-06-00
----------------------------------------
- A substantial reorganisation of G4Transportation::AlongStepGPIL
  to use values already in cache, reduce the number of branches, and
  use extra local variables for track properties to avoid indirections.
  The method is one of the heaviest in many types of simulation workloads.
  Profiling identified a persistent reduction in misses of instruction-TLB
  loads after these changes.

Nov  1st 2019, J.Apostolakis transport-V10-05-02
----------------------------
- Optimisation in G4Transportation and G4CoupledTransportation:
  Avoid calling user field manager's ConfigureForTrack method,
  except if particle is charged, or forces from magnetic moment
  or gravity are enabled.

  * Introduces new common 'flag' in G4(Coupled)Transportation
      to enable gravity fields.
    The following static method must be called if the application uses
    gravity fields:
       G4Transportation::EnableGravity(G4bool useGravity)

- Added flag in G4Transportation/G4CoupledTransportation to
   silence warning about looping tracks.

Aug 15th 2019, D.Sorokin transport-V10-05-01
------------------------
- Enable relaxing of delta chord condition (to reduce looping particle
    issue) for tracks below 'important' energy threshold.

Aug 15th 2019, J.Apostolakis transport-V10-05-00
----------------------------
- G4Transportation and G4CoupledTransportation: fix issues related to
    resetting of looper flag and other state for field propagation.
    * Replaced check for 'Global' field with check for any field.
      This is needed to ensure that propagator-in-field state is
      reset when the setup inludes only local fields.
    * Ensure that looping flag is reset (false) when a force is not exerted
      in G4CoupledTransportation::AlongStepGetPhysicalInteractionLength
      ( Before it was overwritten afterwards. )

   Addresses bugzilla Problem report 2144.
   Thanks to Richard T. Jones (U. Conn) and Laurie Nevay (RHUL) of the
     GlueX experiment team.

Nov 9th  2018, J.Apostolakis transport-V10-04-13
----------------------------
- G4Transportation and G4CoupledTransportation:
    Added method SetLowLooperThresholds for low-E applications.
    Added method ReportLooperThresholds method to print the values.
- G4CoupledTransportation: Additional statistics for loopers
     (to be same as G4Transportation).
- G4TransportationLogger: New ReportLooperThresholds() method.

Nov 9th  2018, G.Cosmo transport-V10-04-12
----------------------
- Use G4cout to print statistics from G4[Coupled]Transportation.

Nov 8th  2018, J.Apostolakis transport-V10-04-11, 10
----------------------------
- G4[Coupled]Transportation: Added extra simple statistics, print stats
  at destruction:
   * New stats: non-electrons loopers killed (sum E, number, max E & its pdg)
   * Record statistics for non-electron loopers killed:
     - total energy
     - maximum energy and the PDG of the type of that track
   * Statistics now printed by a new method,
      and are printed also if verbose = 0  ( was > 0 )
   * Description method, to print key parameters (i.e. for loopers)

Nov 8th  2018, J.Apostolakis transport-V10-04-09
----------------------------
- G4Transportation & G4CoupledTransportation:
  Summary:
     Restored old default energy thresholds for loopers - but only stable particles killed.
  Full information:
  * Added method SetHighLooperThresholds() to restore old default
    parameters for killing looping particles:
     - warning energy to 100 MeV ( particles below this killed silently )
     - important energy to 250 MeV ( above, tracks are given multiple chances)
  * Default constructors now use these high values.
  * Added checks in SetMethods of looper parameters for the presence of Logger
     to report error if logger is missing.
  * New auxiliary methods PushThresholdsToLogger(), ReportMissingLogger()

Nov 7th  2018, J.Apostolakis transport-V10-04-08, 07
----------------------------
- G4Transportation & G4CoupledTransportation:
  * Adjusted killing of looping particles, to apply only to stable particles.
  * Unstable particles will be propagated indefinitely.
  * Added Printing the maximum energy and sum of energies of particles 'saved'
    in G4(Coupled)Transportation destructor.

July 9th  2018, G.Cosmo transport-V10-04-06
-----------------------
- Minor code cleanup in G4[Coupled]Transportation classes.
  Use G4Exception for warnings, instead of streaming to cout/cerr.

June 15th  2018, G.Cosmo transport-V10-04-05
------------------------
- Fixed Coverity warnings...

June 15th  2018, G.Cosmo transport-V10-04-04
------------------------
- Fixed compilation errors on Windows.

June 14th  2018, J.Apostolakis transport-V10-04-03
------------------------------
- New class G4TransportationLogger to consolidate reports from the
  Transportation processes. First step: it now issues the warning Exception
  for looping tracks. Added information on material density, step length.
- G4Transportation and G4CoupledTransportation: changed default threshold from
  0 to 1 keV for warning when abandoning looping tracks.
  Tracks with less energy do not get reported.
  Use G4TransportationLogger to report looping tracks.

June  8th  2018, J.Apostolakis transport-V10-04-02
------------------------------
- Fixed and improved reporting of looping tracks.
  Now issues warning and provides information about position and momentum,
  in addition to energy and its value at pre-step point.

June  8th  2018, G.Cosmo transport-V10-04-01
------------------------
- Some code cleanup in G4Transportation and G4CoupledTransportation.
  Removed few global static symbols introduced in previous tag.

June  7th 2018, J.Apostolakis transport-V10-04-00
-----------------------------
- G4Transportation & G4CoupledTransportation: changed default values of two
  thresholds related to the killing of looping particles:
     'Important' Energy: particles with MORE energy are killed ONLY after
                         multiple steps (fThresholdTrials) marked as 'looping'.
     'Warning'   Energy: particles with LESS energy are killed SILENTLY
     Intermediate value: particles between these energies are killed after
                         one 'looping step' (with warning.)
  New values:  Warning_Energy= 0. Important_Energy= 1.0 * MeV
  NOTES:
   1) This can happen if a track's propagation in field requires a large
      number of integration steps.  ( Default number is 1000, and it is
      accessed by G4PropagatorInField's  Get/Set MaxLoopCount() methods.)
   2) Usually the material is vacuum or very low density material.
      And particles have either low momentum or momentum with a very small
      component along the direction of the magnetic field (zero or nearly zero).

  Improved reporting of the issue of dropped particles (above 'warning'
  threshold'):
    * Provide the type of particle and the position, in addition to
      the energy (already).
    * added recommendations for users if they see the warning.
      (these are printed only for the first 5 warnings).
  Addressing problem report #2063.

November 22st 2017, V.Ivanchenko transport-V10-03-04  (internal)
--------------------------------
- G4NeutronKiller: moved virtual methods from inline to source,
  do not use generic <int> type, should not affect any result.

November 1st 2017, J.Apostolakis transport-V10-03-03
--------------------------------
- Small changes in G4Transportation - early set of 'First' flag.

August 28th 2017, G.Cosmo        transport-V10-03-02
--------------------------
- Make appropriate setting/use of verbosity from base class G4VProcess,
  instead of re-defining/using local verbosity flag in G4Transportation
  and G4CoupledTransportation.
  Addressing problem report #1999.

August 28th 2017, G.Cosmo        transport-V10-03-01
--------------------------------
- Fixed use of G4DEBUG_TRANSPORT flag in G4CoupledTransportation.

August 25th 2017, J.Apostolakis transport-V10-03-00
--------------------------------
- G4CoupledTransportation & G4Transportation: obtain equation of motion
    using dedicated method of ProgatorInField.
    Smaller code, and future proof.

February 12th 2015, J.Apostolakis transport-V10-01-03
--------------------------------
- G4CoupledTransportation:: Made SignifyStepInAnyVolume 'flag' static.
    Stoped using IsLastStepInVolume for step limitation.

January 20th 2015, J.Apostolakis transport-V10-01-02
--------------------------------
- G4CoupledTransportation: Added ability to identify first step in a volume in either
    the mass geometry or in any geometry.  Also added flag for last step in a volume
    in the mass geometry.
    Extends fix of tag transport-V10-01-00.

  Since it is not clear whether user wants/needs to identify the first/last in
    any geometry or just in the mass geometry, allowing this to be a choice:
  Configurable: whether the flag represents a first/last step in mass geometry
  or any geometry (currently the default - what was the case for last step before).
  Also depends in geomnav-V10-01-02 and track-V10-01-00.
  Addresses Bugzilla issue #1032.

January 10th 2014, M.Kelsey transport-V10-01-01
---------------------------
- G4Transportation.cc, G4CoupledTransportation: In
  AlongStepGetPhysicalInteractionLength(), initialize restMass data member
  using G4DynamicParticle (as is used in DoIt), not G4ParticleDefinition.
  Resolves inconsistent kinematics when dynamic mass is measurably different
  from "PDG" mass.

December 17th 2014, J.Apostolakis transport-V10-01-00
---------------------------------
- G4Transportation: Added ability to identify last step in volume for the case of
   propagation in field.
   Requires use of tags in navigation (geomnav-V10-01-02) and track (track-V10-01-00) .
   Addresses Bugzilla issue #1032.

November 21st 2014, J.Apostolakis transport-V10-00-06
--------------------------------- (corrected version of transport-V10-00-04)
- Added initialization of G4CoupledTransportation data members (fixes Coverity issue 15280)
  Renamed data member, to make its name canonical.

October 15th 2014, M.Asai transport-V10-00-05
-------------------------
- G4CoupledTransportation is reverted to transport-V10-00-03.
- G4Transportation and G4CoupledTransportation : made data member
  fUseMagneticMoment and its set method EnableUseMagneticMoment()
  static.

May   27st 2014, V.Ivanchenko transport-V10-00-03
------------------------------
- G4UserSpecialCuts - fixed trivial Coverity report

May   21st 2014, J.Apostolakis transport-V10-00-02
------------------------------
- Revised  AlongStepDoIt methods of G4Transportation and
   G4CoupledTransportation:
   * Adapted to revised signature for G4FieldTrack constructors,
     which now take PDG spin.
   * Changed to use different constructor for G4FieldTrack (no Velocity)
   * Adapted to revised signature of G4ChargeState constructor (PDG spin is
     now 3rd argument and mandatory. )

NOTE: Requires tag field-V10-00-03 of geometry/magneticfield


March 14th 2014, J.Apostolakis transport-V10-00-01
------------------------------
- Fix time in case of zero step, in G4CoupledTransportation.
  This caused a 'going back in time' error, when a zero step occurred
  in particular at the boundary of a parallel world volume when scoring.

  > Corrects Issue 1017 in the Geant4 Problem reporting System
    http://bugzilla-geant4.kek.jp/show_bug.cgi?id=1017

  NOTE: Requires tag geomnav-V10-00-01

October 18th 2013, J.Apostolakis transport-V09-06-07

  finder (or field manager) is not defined.

May 8th, 2013, P.Gumplinger, J.Apostolakis transport-V09-06-04
------------------------------------------
- Adapted G4Transportation and G4CoupledTransportation to use G4ChargeState
  for charge/spin/magnetic moment, and to message the equation of motion
  directly with it.
  The tag(s) above co-work with and requires the following tags:
  had-binary-V09-06-05, geomnav-V09-06-06 and field-V09-06-04.

Mar. 22nd, 2013, G. Cosmo transport-V09-06-03

  Modified files: G4Transportation.cc and G4CoupledTransportation.cc.

Jul. 12th, 2011, J.Apostolakis transport-V09-05-02
------------------------------
- G4Transportation.cc:
    Corrected issues with initialisation of data members reported by Coverity.
    Renamed data member endpointdistance to fEndPointDistance (to conform).

Jul. 5th, 2012 Gabriele Cosmo transport-V09-05-01
-----------------------------
- Explicitly use inclusion of headers for system of units and physical
  constants, in plan to remove implicit inclusion from globals.hh.

Jun. 7th, 2012 Gabriele Cosmo transport-V09-05-00
-----------------------------
- Fixed spurious cases of hidden variable visibility, detected with
  '-Wshadow' compilation option on gcc compiler.

Nov. 4th, 2011, J.Apostolakis transport-V09-04-13
-----------------------------
- Turned off tracking for magnetic moment - by default.
  It can be enabled in
    G4Transportation, G4CoupledTransportation
  by using the new method EnableUseMagneticMoment().
  Should ensure particles with a moment are not affected
  unless user needs this.

Nov. 4th, 2011, J.Apostolakis transport-V09-04-12
-----------------------------
* Reduce overhead of the addition of Gravity
- G4Transportation: Revised condition for gravity field (version 1).
  G4CoupledTransportation: Revised the field-detection condition,
   with improved logic to cope with ConfigureForTrack (for any field) (v2).
  Deleted dependence on G4UniformGravityField in both.
  Tag coworks with field-V09-04-05

Nov. 1st, 2011, P.Gumplinger transport-V09-04-11
-----------------------------
- add condition to the condition, gravity != NULL, that the particle's mass is
  also restMass != 0.0. Modify G4CoupledTransportation.cc according to
  G4Transportation.cc

Oct. 28th, 2011, P.Gumplinger transport-V09-04-10
-----------------------------
- allow for spin tracking of neutral particles with a magn. moment;
  allow for uniform gravity field tracking of neutral particles;
  tag coworks with field-V09-04-03.

Oct. 28th, 2011, P.Gumplinger transport-V09-04-09
-----------------------------
- remove all special reverence and logic regarding "opticalphoton" from code
  in G4Transportation.cc and G4CoupledTransportation.cc

Aug. 8th, 2011, H.Kurashige  transport-V09-04-08
---------------------------
- Modify calculation of deltaTime for optical photon in Transportation (and CoupledTransportation)
  Use the updated velocity obtained from G4Track::CalculateVelocityForOpticalPhoton
  instead of the initial velocity of the step.
  (see problem #1239)
  [ This is because the velocity at the initial point can refer to
  a previous volume.  If the PreStepPoint was on a surface, we
  the previous step was in another volume, which shared this
  PreStepPoint --> and its velocity would be wrong. ]

July 6th, 2011, H.Kurashige  transport-V09-04-07
---------------------------
- Modify G4Transportation (and CoupledTtansportation)
  to propose the final local time rather than the global time
  so that local time can be updated properly.
  (see problem #1224)
  [ This adapts to the recent change in Tracking, which made
  the change of LocalTime trigger the change of Global Time
  (instead of vice-versa). ]

June 10th, 2011, J.Apostolakis  transport-V09-04-06
------------------------------
- Fix for invalid safety passed to SafetyHelper.

June 10th, 2011, J.Apostolakis  transport-V09-04-05
------------------------------
- Fix G4Transportation::AlongStepDoIt
  Use only initial velocity to update time. An estimate of velocity
  at endpoint is not yet available. (finalVelocity still= initial)
    ==> It will be updated later in the tracking sequence, when
        energy loss is applied, and it will be available to
	Transportation only in the PostStepDoIt()

May 26th, 2011, H.Kurashige  transport-V09-04-04
---------------------------
- Define ProcessSubType for processes under transportation category
- Change process type of G4NeutronBuilder to fGeneral

January 26th, 2011, G.Cosmo  transport-V09-04-03
---------------------------
- Simplified implementation of G4CoupledTransportation::EndTracking(), to
  avoid unnecessary static pointer definition.

January 21th, 2011, V.Ivanchenko  transport-V09-04-02
--------------------------------
- G4UserSpecialCuts - fixed compilation problem

January 21th, 2011, V.Ivanchenko  transport-V09-04-01
--------------------------------
- G4UserSpecialCuts: fixed bug in energy tracking cut; changed order
  of checks: 1st energy tracking cut, 2nd track length, 3d time cut,
  4th range for charged particles with non-zero mass; removed unnecessary
  string comparisons.

January 4th, 2011, M.Asai  transport-V09-04-00
-------------------------
- G4CoupledTransportation: added EndTracking() method to reset the
  activated navigator list.

September 13th, 2010, J.Apostolakis  transport-V09-03-01
-----------------------------------
- Improvement to G4Transportation: copy current safety to SafetyHelper each
  time it is computed (it used to be copied only when it was recalculated at
  end of step).

September 13th, 2010, J.Apostolakis  transport-V09-03-00
----------------------------------
- Retagged - to propose for testing.

November 17th, 2009, J.Apostolakis  transport-V09-02-00
----------------------------------
- G4Transportation:
  o Fix: Update the Step flag which identifies the Last Step in a volume
     It is now done for the linear steps (no charge or no field)

November 26th, 2008, J.Apostolakis  transport-V09-01-03
----------------------------------
- G4CoupledTransportation:
  o Fix: initialise new data member (in constructor) - found by STT

November 21st, 2008, J.Apostolakis  transport-V09-01-02
----------------------------------
- G4Transportation & G4CoupledTransportation:
  o Performance improvement/correction
     Avoid to compute safety at end of step for neutral particles

November 21st, 2008, J.Apostolakis  transport-V09-01-01
----------------------------------

- G4Transportation & G4CoupledTransportation:
  o Push value & origin of safety to SafetyHelper
     only when its value comes from ComputeSafety

January 17th, 2008, J.Apostolakis  transport-V09-01-00
---------------------------------
- G4Transportation & G4CoupledTransportation:
  o Clear state of all Chord Finders using G4FieldManagerStore.
- Syncronised with files on the HEAD.
- Requires co-working tag "field-V09-01-00" (or "field-V09-00-03").
  Functionality corresponding to tag "transport-V09-00-52".

November 27th, 2007, J.Apostolakis  transport-V09-00-08
----------------------------------
- G4CoupledTransportation
  o Added updating of particle-looping flag (was commented out.).

November 10th, 2007, J.Apostolakis  transport-V09-00-07
----------------------------------
- G4Transportation:
  o Put back the default for short step optimisation to 'on'.

November 9th, 2007, J.Apostolakis  transport-V09-00-06
---------------------------------
- G4Transportation:
  o Update the SafetyHelper using the safety calculated by Navigator.

November 27th, 2007, J.Apostolakis  transport-V09-00-05a
----------------------------------
- G4CoupledTransportation
  o Added updating of particle-looping flag (was commented out.)
- Also called "transport-V09-00-51" to make it canonical.

November 8th, 2007, J.Apostolakis  transport-V09-00-05
---------------------------------
- G4Transportation:
  o Created new method (and class member) for flag on Short StepOptimisation.
    * When it is true, the optimisation is 'on' steps shorter than the
      safety will not call G4Navigator - so long as the particle goes straight
      ie it is not charged or there is no field.
    * Retained the default value as 'off' - as since changed in
      transport-V09-00-02 following Alex's suggestion.

November 8th, 2007, J.Apostolakis  transport-V09-00-04
---------------------------------
- G4Transportation (AlongStepGPIL):
  o Moved the call to ConfigureForTrack before the check whether
    fieldMgr has 0 field ptr, in order to enable it to be called
    even if the field manager points to a zero field.
    Needed to enable a user to switch a global field on (off was possible),
    as a track goes between volume (or regions) of a setup.
    [ Response to request of Atlas/ZM. ]
    Note: this ordering already existed in G4CoupledTransportation.

October 12th, 2007, J.Apostolakis  transport-V09-00-03
---------------------------------
- G4CoupledTransportation:

October 4th, 2007, J.Apostolakis  transport-V09-00-02
--------------------------------
- G4CoupledTransportation:
  o First fix for problem in condition for Relocating when only a parallel
    geometry limited the step.
  o Change of condition for recalculation safety (from Alex Howard) used,
    as currently it improves stability.

September 25th, 2007, J.Apostolakis  transport-V09-00-01
-----------------------------------
- G4Transportation:
  Modification to disable 'optimisation' in G4Navigator for small linear
  step  (ie when a track does less than the safety).
    * Relevant only if there is no field, or the particle is neutral
    * Temporary measure (in current form) to improve comparison
        old / new Transportation  (single/old vs coupled with pathfinder).

July 12th, 2007, J.Apostolakis  transport-V09-00-00
------------------------------

- Gone back to G4CoupledTransportation.
  o G4Transportation is now the original (what was called G4Transportation8
    since "transport-V08-03-03").
  o G4Transportation8 still exists, to enable code that utilises it to compile
    (transitional). Expect that G4Transportation8 will be taken away asap.

May 29th, 2007, J.Apostolakis  transport-V08-03-04
-----------------------------
- G4Transportation. Refined relocation:
  o Full (re)location only if any geometry limited the step.

----------------------------
- G4Transportation (hh,icc,cc)
  o Renamed G4CoupledTransportation to G4Transportation
  o Merged changes on branch used to bring in CoupledTransportation,
    porting changes in G4Transportation since the creation of
    CoupledTransportation.
  o Also merged branch used for fixes in G4Transportation.cc (1.60.2, 1.60.4)
    for convergence to Release 9.0.

February 15th, 2007, J.Apostolakis  transport-V08-02-01
----------------------------------
- G4Transportation: protection against velocity=0 in AlongStep (invalid).

February 15th, 2007, J.Apostolakis  transport-V08-02-00
----------------------------------
- G4Transportation: call PropagatorInField to clear state for new track
   --> addresses reliabilitiy problem seen by Atlas.  This fix is related
       to overlaps, clearing the safety value (which is multivalued due
       to the overlaps, and thus can become invalid for a new track in
       an overlap region.)

    to make up for the fact that some other processes only have PostStep GPILs
    which cannot currently influence safety.
- NOTE: Fix / Workaround for deficiency of others.

November 13th, 2006, J.Apostolakis  transport-V08-01-01
---------------------------------

  clear the state for a new track, and to message other relevant
  component to clear their state (problem report and proposed revision
  by P.MoraDeFreitas).

Jan. 16th, 2006, J.Apostolakis transport-V08-00-00
------------------------------
- G4Transportation:
  o The particle's charge is now taken from the dynamic particle, so that
    it can take into account changes from the interaction of an ion with

  This should help to locate "suspended" tracks.

April 24, 2002  G.Cosmo - transport-V04-00-05
-----------------------
- Added G4DEBUG_TRANSPORT flag in GNUmakefile and (on suggestionh of
  J.Apostolakis) replaced to G4VERBOSE in G4Transportation::PostStepDoIt()

  value of the spin in the cases where a particle was not charged (eg photon)
  or a charged particle was not in a field.

Apr  11, 2001   P. Gumplinger   transport-V03-01-01
-----------------------------

    with:
      fTransportEndSpin = aFieldTrack.GetSpin();
  o Added to the AlongStepDoIt() the following call:
      fParticleChange.SetPolarizationChange(fTransportEndSpin);

Mar  19, 2001   J. Apostolakis  transport-V03-00-01
------------------------------
- G4Transportation modified to use new FieldTrack, and get Kinetic
  Energy from it.
  This new FieldTrack together with changes in associated Equation of Motion
  classes implement the momentum vector as independent variable in place of
  the velocity.
  So this tag requires
  - new geometry/magneticfield tag "field-V03-00-01",  and
  - new geometry/volumes  tag "geomvol-V03-00-03" for new
    G4PropagatorInField ().

Feb  27, 2001   J. Apostolakis  (transport-V03-00-00)
------------------------------
- G4Transportation.cc:
  *   Modified calculation of energy at the end of field step
       to make it more accurate at low velocities,
       (while remaining correct at high gammas).
  This improves the energy determination.
  Together with electromagnetic/standard tag  "stand-V03-00-03"
  this addresses the main problem in propagating in an electric field
  (Problem report # 108 )

Sep  22, 2000   V. Grichine	(transport-V02-00-00)  [recorded by G.Cosmo]
---------------------------
- G4Transportation.cc:
  o added formula for Tkin corresponding directly to
    relativistic definition of Tkin = Etot - mc^2 = mc^2(gamma -1),
    where gamma is a particle Lorentz factor.
  o general cosmetics.

Jun  19, 2000   J. Apostolakis  (transport-V01-01-02)
------------------------------
- G4Transportation.cc: Set the True Step Length in G4Transportation.cc
- Cosmetic:  updated other files to the head, as there were no differences
  from it (CVS headers).

May  15, 2000   J. Apostolakis	(transport-V01-01-01)
------------------------------
- G4Transportation.cc:  Set the material in materialChange, in order to get
  correct behaviour for volumes that parameterise the material.
  (Fix is dependant on changes to particleChangeForTransport and StepPoint)
- Modified setting of touchable change, in order to preserve const-ness where
  it exists.

Nov  25, 1999   J. Apostolakis  (transport-V00-01-01)
------------------------------
- G4Transportation.cc: Added protection for the case of a zero step (when
  there is a field)
- G4UserSpecialCuts: protection to use min range and min kinE only for
  charged particles.

June  9, 1999   J. Apostolakis  (transport-01-00-02)
------------------------------
- Added a protection so that full relocation is not used for very small moves.

Dec   4, 1998   J. Apostolakis  (transport-00-04-01)
------------------------------
- The Velocity Vector for Transport in a magnetic field is now set correctly.
  (previously the scalar velocity was automatically promoted to a 3-vector)

Nov  25, 1998  J. Apostolakis
-----------------------------
- Added the direction to  LocateGlobalPointAndUpdateTouchable.

Nov  19, 1998   J. Apostolakis  (transport-00-03-04)
------------------------------
- Fixes:
  1) The final energy is set equal to the initial energy, because
     the PropagatorInField does not calculate it correctly yet.  NEEDS Fix
  2) If the requested step size is zero and safety is zero,  the
     step is now considered geometry limited.  (This can happen
     if a discrete process tries to take a  step that is very small
     compared to the mean free path.)  Problem observed by Laszlo in EM tests.
  3) PostStepGetInteractionLength now returns DBL_MAX, not kInfinity.

Nov  11, 1998   J. Apostolakis  (transport-00-03-03)
------------------------------
- Changes to accomodate new interface of Field:
  G4PropagatorInField and G4FieldTrack.

Oct  30, 1998  J. Apostolakis   (transport-00-03-02)
-----------------------------
- In the case of magnetic field, a flag that determines whether the
  geometry limited the step was not set.

Sep  16, 1998  J. Apostolakis   (transport-00-03-01)
-----------------------------
- Checks whether the particle is out of the world volume,
  if so it has exited and must be killed.

Aug  28, 1998  J. Apostolakis
-----------------------------
- The PostStepGetPhysicalInteractionLength has fixed (to return kInf)
  The boolean flags for touchables are now initialised. & Other small fixes ?
  Test code for non-relocating case added (for debugging).

June 08, 1998   J. Apostolakis  (trans-06-04)
------------------------------
- Corrected Safety computation for the case of the field (adding endpoint
  distance instead of curve length.)
- Added PostStepDoIt method that tries to relocate the particle using
  G4ParticleChangeForTransport
- Transportation is no longer a G4ContinuousProcess.

June 08, 1998   J. Apostolakis  (trans-06-03)
------------------------------
- Modified it to recomputate Safety at the start of a step.  To do this
  it uses the previous step's  calculated safety and endpoint.

June 08, 1998   J. Apostolakis  (trans-06-02)
------------------------------
- Modified it to add re-computation of Safety at the endpoint of a step,
  when the safety would become negative.  This is done to allow processes
  to benefit from a realistic (geometrical) value of the safety.  The
  request to do this was from EM physics

June 03, 1998   J. Apostolakis  (trans-06-01)
------------------------------
- The safety we is now generalised to mean the limit of assumption of all
  processes. The AlongStepGPIL input value is not the remainder from the
  previous step's geometrical safety.
  So the transportation must recalculate the starting point's safety here.
  As a zeroeth order approximation we set it to zero.

April 17, 1998  M. Maire      [recorded by John Apostolakis]
------------------------
- A new process, G4UserSpecialCuts, was added to allow the
  user an alternative method to set some user cuts.

April 15, 1998  H. Kurasige   [recorded by John Apostolakis]
---------------------------
- The transportation does the absolute minimum required to conform to
  the new scheme for ParticleChange: G4VParticleChange is used in signature.
  [ But default G4ParticleChange is still used ].
