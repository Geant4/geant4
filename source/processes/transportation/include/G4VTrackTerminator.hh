// Class G4VTrackTerminator
//
// Class description:
//
// This is an interface for an object which can be called to kill a track.
// The type it provides is needed in case importance biasing and scoring
// is done at the same time. 
// For navigation in the parallel geometry which is done by the importance
// biasing process (it derives from G4ParallelTransport), importance biasing
// has to be done before scoring (to score the correct volume).
// But since scoring would not be called if the importance biasing kills a
// track, it only tells a G4VTrackTerminator to kill the track.
// The scoring process implements the interface G4VTrackTerminator
// and is now able to kill the track after it has performed the scoring.
