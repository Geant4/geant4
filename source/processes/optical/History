                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

17th March 2004 Peter Gumplinger (op-V06-00-03)
                Assign all class members in constructor.

24th February 2004 Gabriele Cosmo (op-V06-00-02)
                Added EOL at end of file in G4OpBoundaryProcess.cc to clear
                compilation warning in Linux-g++.

19th February 2004 Peter Gumplinger (op-V06-00-01)
                Add process status: NotAtBoundary, SameMaterial, 
                                    StepTooSmall, NoRINDEX
                Allow for a skin-surface between mother and daughter
                volumes, with the daughter skin taking precedence.

2nd February 2004 Peter Gumplinger (op-V06-00-00)
                Set theStatus = Undefined at start of DoIt
                Replace usage of 0 with NULL.
 
1st December 2003 Peter Gumplinger (op-V05-02-02)
                G4OpBoundaryProcess.cc: modified to adopt G4SurfaceProperty.
                Requires tag "materials-V05-02-00".
		Replaced usage of NULL with 0.

4th October 2003 Gabriele Cosmo (op-V05-02-01)
                Modified GNUmakefile: added dependency to new module
                "geometry/navigation".
                Coworks with "geometry-V05-02-00" and "digits_hits-V05-02-00".

23rd September 2003 Peter Gumplinger (op-V05-02-00)
                Add WLS (wavelength shifting) process
15th March 2003 Peter Gumplinger (op-V05-00-01)
                Change logic for assigning of Rindex2; bug report #444
4th February 2003 Peter Gumplinger (op-V05-00-00)
                Fix calculation of polarization for perpendicular
                incidence when Rindex1 > Rindex2; bug report #442 
12th November 2002 Peter Gumplinger (op-V04-01-01)
                Fix calculation of polarization on dielectric dielectric
                interfaces; bug report #427
28th March 2002 Peter Gumplinger (op-V04-00-01)
                Add public inline method GetStatus and make enum 
                G4OpBoundaryProcessStatus public in G4OpBoundaryProcess.hh
18th October 2001 Peter Gumplinger (op-V03-02-01)
              Avoid warnings on Linux (gcc-2.95.2) compiler
- G4OpRayleigh.cc: remove unused variable 'aMaterial' in PostStepDoIt and
                   'no_unit' in RayleighAttenuationLengthGenerator
- G4OpBoundaryProcess.cc: moved definition of E2_perp, E2_parl, E2_total
                          outside IF-statement
31st August 2001 Peter Gumplinger (op-V03-02-00)
- G4OpRayleigh.hh, G4OpBoundary.hh and G4OpAbsorption.hh: changed processName
                   to 'OpRayleigh', 'OpBoundary' and 'OpAbsorption' respectively

30th January 2001 Peter Gumplinger (op-V03-00-05)
- G4OpRayleigh.cc: allow for positiv and negative CosTheta and force the
                   new momentum direction to be in the same plane as the
                   new and old polarization vectors
                   still bug report: 207

29th January 2001 Peter Gumplinger (op-V03-00-04)
- G4OpRayleigh.cc: fix calculation of SinTheta from CosTheta
                   bug report: 207

23rd January 2001 Peter Gumplinger (op-V03-00-02)
- G4OpRayleigh.cc: Allow for Rayleigh scattering length to be defined for 
           arbitrary material through the use of G4MaterialPropertyTable.

5th October 2000  Peter Gumplinger (op-V02-00-02)
- G4OpAbsorption.cc: Comment out warning - No Absorption length specified.

3rd August 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (op-V02-00-00r)
- G4OpBoundaryProcess.cc: changed RandGauss to G4RandGauss to fix problem
  of events' reproducibility.
- Syncronized with HEAD (only CVS headers changes).

21th October 1999  Peter Gumplinger (op-V00-01-01)
- G4OpBoundaryProcess.hh and G4OpBoundaryProcess.cc have been modified
  (Fill NewMomentum/NewPolarization in DoAbsorption. These members need
  to be filled since DoIt calls aParticleChange.SetMomentumChange etc.
  upon return (thanks to: Clark McGrew)
