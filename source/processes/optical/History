  for Rindex1 > Rindex2. Thanks to M. van Dijk (Bristol University).

16th October 2014 P. Gumplinger (op-V10-00-07)
- previous tag was committed only to /include directory

10th October 2014 P. Gumplinger (op-V10-00-06)
- G4OpRayleigh Process: This version calculates the Rayleigh scattering
  length for more materials than just Water (although the Water default
  is kept). To do this the user would need to specify the
  ISOTHERMAL_COMPRESSIBILITY as a material property and optionally an
  RS_SCALE_LENGTH (useful for testing). Code comes from Philip Graham
  (Queen Mary University of London).

  In this first implementation, the photon is either reflected or transmitted
  without changing direction. Surface->SetType(dielectric_dichroic);
  You must also supply a 2D data file with the format:
  4     #ofWavelength-bins     #ofIncidentAngle-bins
  List of Wavelength-bin values in nm (i)
  List of IncidentAngle-bin values in deg (j) - angle from the normal
  Transmittance[1,1],..,Transmittance[i,1],..,Transmittance[n,1]
  .....................,Transmittance[i,j],.....................

17th Oct.2012 J.Apostolakis (op-V09-05-11)
	      Avoid the 'new' Event-abort exception, by 'protecting' 
                 it with G4DEBUG_OPTICAL_PROC flag.
              By default, the normal is now flipped instead 
                 (as Geant4 9.5 and 9.5 patch 1 worked.)

 5th Oct.2012 J.Apostolakis (op-V09-05-10) 
              G4OpBoundaryProcess now uses GlobalExitNormal()

              G4OpMieHG.hh and G4OpBoundaryProcess.hh -
              more fixing Coverity warnings

16th May 2012 P.Gumplinger (op-V09-05-01)
              G4OpBoundaryProcess.cc - trying to fix Coverity warnings

24th Jan 2012 P.Gumplinger (op-V09-05-00)
              G4OpBoundaryProcess.cc - solves Problem #1275
              call aParticleChange.ProposeVelocity(aTrack.GetVelocity())
              at every invocation of DoIt; for FresnelRefraction calculate
              finalVelocity locally from Material2->

14th Jun 2011 Peter Gumplinger (op-V09-04-00)
              A dielectric_dielectric surface may now have a wavelength
              dependent property "TRANSMITTANCE". If this is specified
              for a surface it overwrites the Snell's law's probability.
              This allows the simulation of anti-reflective coatings.
              Thanks to Evgueni Goudzovski (CERN) for the idea.

14th Jun 2010 Peter Gumplinger (op-V09-03-03)
              ProposeLocalEnergyDeposit(thePhotonMomentum) every time the
              photon is fStopAndKill because of NoRINDEX. This will trigger
              scoring when a photon encounters a volume not defined as an
              optical medium (indirect user request):
              http://hypernews.slac.stanford.edu/HyperNews/geant4/get/opticalphotons/335/1.html

              fix Problem report #1114 in that for backpainted
              surfaces theReflectivity is not applied twice. 
              While doing the fix I also completely refashioning the 
              code in the case of type == dielectric_dielect.

19th Jan 2010 Peter Gumplinger (op-V09-03-00)
              assign PropertyPointers to NULL at the start of the
              PostStepDoIt, addresses bug report #1094

19th Nov 2009 Peter Gumplinger (op-V09-02-06)
              change the code such that the LUT are now read in and kept
              by G4OpticalSurface and not G4OpBoundaryProcess, reordering
              of enumeration and set theStatus in DielectricLUT.

11th Nov 2009 Peter Gumplinger (op-V09-02-05)
              add capability of simulating surface reflections
              with Look-Up-Tables (LUT) containing measured
              optical reflectance for a variety of surface
              treatments - Thanks to Martin Janecek and
              William Moses (Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.)

              G4OpBoundary: initialze theReflectivity and theEfficiency
              at the beginning of the PostStepDoIt; add method
              BoundaryProcessVerbose which will now print the process
              status for every call to PostStepDoIt.

5th  Nov 2009 Peter Gumplinger (op-V09-02-03)
              G4OpBoundary::PostStepDoIt - all dielectric_dielectric
              surfaces may now have a reflectivity <1; not only
              'frontpainted' as was the case in the past.

6th  May 2009 Peter Gumplinger (op-V09-02-02)
              G4OpBoundary::PostStepDoIt now throws an G4Exception
              EventMustBeAborted when an invalid surface normal is returnd;
              addresses bug report #1060

23th Mar 2009 Peter Gumplinger (op-V09-02-01)
              for complex index of refraction: (1)resample the reflectivity
              every time in the do-while of DielectricMetal, but don't
              re-calculate theFacetNormal (which has already been chosen
              in CalculateReflectivity), also (2) avoid an infinite loop by
              resetting iTE and iTM inside the do-while of GetReflectivity;
              both are bug-fixes.

14th Jan 2009 Peter Gumplinger (op-V09-02-00)
              respond to bug report 1040 by fixing G4OpBoundaryProcess.cc

5th June 2008 Peter Gumplinger (op-V09-01-00)
              G4OpBoundaryProcess: Removed G4Swap methods - replaced by
              G4SwapPtr. Removed G4IsotropicRand method - replaced by
              G4RandomDirection. Add commented code to change absorption
              at a dielectric/metal boundary into transmission.

              Thanks to Sehwook Lee and John Hauptman
              (Dept. of Physics - Iowa State Univ.)

11th May 2007 Gabriele Cosmo (op-V08-03-00)
              Use call to G4GeometryTolerance instead of kCarTolerance in
              G4OpBoundaryProcess.
              Requires tag "global-V08-03-00" and related tag set.

11th May 2006 Peter Gumplinger (op-V08-00-01)
              thanks to Andreia Trindade and Pedro Rodrigues, the WLS time

                Fix bug in G4PlaneVectorRand and resample
                theFacetNormal for LobeReflection in DielectricMetal

12th August 2004 Peter Gumplinger (op-V06-02-01)
                In G4OpBoundaryProcess.cc: use GetMaterial from 
                G4StepPoint directly; apply/sample reflectivity and 
                Unified model reflection parameters only once even
                for rough dielectric/metal surfaces - i.e. not again
                even when reflected ray still points toward the
                surface - fixes problem report 654.

05th August 2004 Peter Gumplinger (op-V06-02-00)
                Allow for unified model reflectivity parameters 
                to also work in case of dielectric_metal surfaces;
                addresses in part problem report 654.
