                      Category History file
                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

June 05, 2011 P.Arce (procscore-V09-03-03)
- Fix in G4ScoreSplittingProcess::PostStepDoIt() to not consider steps
  if the voxel boundary is not skipped.
  Addressing problem report #1209.

May 01, 2011 M.Asai
- Added IsAtRestRequired() method to G4ParallelWorldScoringProcess.

December 15, 2010 G.Cosmo (procscore-V09-03-02)
- Fixed creation of touchable-history to allow DLL builds on Windows.

November 26, 2010 G.Cosmo (procscore-V09-03-01)
- Fixed compilation warnings for unused parameters.

November 23, 2010 J.Apostolakis (procscore-V09-03-00)
- G4ScoreSplittingProcess spread values for all steps
  in a Voxel-based "Regular" volume.
  Requires tag in run, "run-V09-03-08".

November 18, 2010 J.Apostolakis 
- Added G4EnergySplitter (created by Pedro Arce) 

September 7th, 2008 M.Asai (procscore-V09-01-01)
- Correction of incorrect modification in the previous tag.

February 12th, 2008 M.Asai (procscore-V09-01-00)
- Add copying non-ionizing energy deposit in G4Step.

May 30th A.Howard (procscore-V08-03-03)
- clean tag with files in the right place (!)


May 30th A.Howard (procscore-V08-03-02)
- Moved biasing classes and tests into processes/biasing

May 18th A.Howard (procscore-V08-03-01)
- Added comment to exception in G4NewProcessPlacer to emphasise configuration
after physics list


May 16th A.Howard (procscore-V08-03-00)
- Fixed bug in G4ScoreProcess which didn't get applied to non-parallel geometries
- Updated NewProcessPlacer to recognise old transportation (Transportation8)
- Updated examples (to get back to old transportation and reminder about
arguments)


April 14th M.Asai (procscore-V08-02-00)
- Set step status for ghost pre-step point.

November 28th A.Howard (procscore-V08-01-04)
- updated history file

November 28th A.Howard (procscore-V08-01-03)
- removed duplicated base classes which can be found in processes/transportation

November 20th A.Howard (procscore-V08-01-02)
- updated history file

November 20th A.Howard (procscore-V08-01-01)
- added biasing and related scoring classes, 1st implementation to new parallel
  implementation
- two examples B01_para and B02_para - translated from B01 and B02

November 13th  M.Asai (procscore-V08-01-00)
- Corresponds to the change of G4PathFinder::ComputeStep.

November 8th  M.Asai
- Use the new G4VUserPhysicsList::AddTransportation() which
  automatically replace G4Transporation with G4CoupledTransportation
  if a parallel world is defined.

November 6th  J.Allison
- test1:
  o Made top world volumes invisible.
  o Improved vis.mac.

November 3rd  J.Allison
- test1: Simple vis.mac to illustrate visualisation of parallel worlds.
  Execute with just two parameters, for example:
    ParaTest para disp

November 2nd  J.Allison
- test1:
  o Replaced A01VisManager by G4VisExecutive.
  o Introduced vis.mac.

July 6th, 2006  M.Asai
- Directory processes/scoring created
- History file Created
