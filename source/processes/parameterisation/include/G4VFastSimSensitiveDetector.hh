/**
 * @brief Base class for the sensitive detector used within the fast simulation
 *
 * Base class for a sensitive detector that allows to store hits created in the
 * fast simulation models. It must me used in addition to inheritance from the
 * usual base class `G4VSensitiveDetector` for processing of energy deposited
 * in G4Step.
 * ProcessHits(...) method must be implemented and describe how hits should be
 * saved in the hit collections. It is invoked by Hit method which is public and
 * can be called directly in the fast simulation model (if sensitive detector is
 * known to the model), or via the helper class G4FastSimHitMaker that will
 * locate appropriate volume and retrieve its sensitive detector.
 * An extended example extended/parameterisations/Par03 demonstrates how to use
 * G4VFastSimSensitiveDetector to deposit energy from fast simulation and
 * compare it to the detailed simulation.
