 Modified : G4Exception.cc G4StateManager.hh globals.hh

June 21, 2002 G.Cosmo (global-V04-01-00)
- G4Allocator.hh: changed definition of page size to become data-member of
  G4Allocator. fPageSize is now computed according to the size of the object
  to be allocated. The default size is 1024 bytes for objects whose size is
  less than 512 bytes, 10 times the size of the object otherwise.
  To be benchmarked before put it in production.

May 30, 2002 G.Cosmo (global-V04-00-08)

May 24, 2002 G.Cosmo (global-V04-00-07)
- Introduced temporary modifications for porting on gcc-3.1 compiler:
  o g4std/strstream: deactivate gcc-3.1 specific __DEPRECATED flag.
  o G4strstreambuf.icc: correct patch for overflow() to be specific only to
    gcc-3.0.X versions of the compiler. Behavior now fixed in gcc-3.1.
  o G4llocator.hh: use pointer to member data to compute offset in FreeSingle().
    for gcc-3.1 compiler. gcc-3.1 complains and does not correctly handle offsets
    computed from non-POD types. Pointers to member data should be used instead.
    This advanced C++ feature seems not to work on earlier versions of the same
    compiler or on other system configurations.
- Cosmetics for Software Reference Manual on G4Allocator related headers.

May 15, 2002 G.Cosmo (global-V04-00-06)

January 28, 2002 G.Cosmo (global-V04-00-02)
- G4strstream.icc: temporary fix to G4strstream::overflow(int) for GNU gcc-3.0.X
  compilers, which require returning of character c in case of <CR>.

  256 to 1024 characters.

June 26, 2000 G.Cosmo (global-V01-01-05)
- Fixes for problem report #104, STLInterface:
  o defs.h: defined G4RWTHROW(a) to abort() in case G4NO_STD_EXCEPTIONS
    is set.
  o tpsrtvec.icc, tvordvec.icc: corrected implementation of last() in case
    of call to G4RWTHROW(a).
  o cstring.icc: defined function G4String::strcasecompare(a,b) which will
    NOT invoke the non-ANSI function strcasecmp(a,b) when G4USE_STD_NAMESPACE

  with natural logarithmic scale for energy/momentum bins. (M.G.Pia)

March 21, 2000 G.Cosmo (global-V01-01-01)
- STLInterface: forced initialization of vectors' members also for
  ordered/sorted collections. Even when using the access operator
  vector::operator[] as left-hand operand, it requires the vector
  to be not empty. Removed usage of vector::reserve(capacity).

March 11, 2000 G.Cosmo (global-V01-01-00)
- STLInterface: implemented correct behavior for vectors' default constructors,
  as expected by the RW interface.
  o for pointer/value ordered/sorted collections, an EMPTY STL vector is
    created and the vector capacity is set to G4RWDEFAULT_CAPACITY
    using vector::reserve(capacity). No element initialisation is done.
  o for pointer/value simple collections, a default constructor creating
    an EMPTY STL vector is implemented; the constructor taking the capacity
    as argument, creates an STL vector of the given capacity and explicitly
    initialises its elements. NB: pointers are initialised to zero.
- Added "g4std/complex" wrapper file (V.Grichine)

February 16, 2000 H.Kurashige (global-V01-00-04)

- STLInterface/cstring.icc: fixed yet another bug in G4String::toUpper()
  and G4String::toLower(). Loop over the string characters was causing
  bounds overflow.
- tpvector[.h.icc]: added resize(size_t) method which was missing!

January 31, 2000 G.Cosmo (global-V01-00-02)
- STLInterface: several fixes.
  o Fixed bug in G4String::toUpper().
    (bug was introduced inadvertently on 20-Oct-1999).
  o Added checks for bound-overflows in G4RWTPtrSortedVector::find().
  o Fixed bound-check for operators () and [] in most collections:
    () access operators DO NOT perform bound-checking (except if G4DEBUG set);
    [] access operators DO perform bound-checking.
  o tpvector[.h.icc]: changed 'unsigned int' to 'size_t' in constructors.
    Added 'rwsize' and bound-checking for operator[].
  o tvvector.icc: added call to std_vector() in default constructor.
  o tpordvec.icc: added std_pvector:: scope for calls to [] operator,
    where missing.
  o tvordvec.icc: added std_vector:: scope for calls to [] operator,
    where missing.

November 25, 99 G.Cosmo (global-V00-01-12)
- STLInterface: changes for ISO/ANSI C++ support:

    scope. Introduced std_vector and std_pvector for collections,
    replaced G4std::vector<T> and G4std::vector<T*> accordingly.

  in before globals.hh. Several of this cases experienced on HP-aCC.
- STLInterface/rw/tphdict.h: added find() method to retrieve a key.

May 24, 99 G.Cosmo (global-01-00-03)

- Updates and fixes to STLInterface headers. Input mainly from DEC and HP.
- Added G4Poisson.hh to HEPRandom/include. It includes the implementation
  of the global function "G4long G4Poisson(G4double)" which reproduces the

  basic random generators.

May 3, 99 G.Cosmo (global-01-00-00)
- Updates to STL interface ISO/ANSI headers (F.Benher)
- Added G4Exception call with STL strings in globals.hh and G4Exception.cc (F.Benher)

  DEC cxx 5.X compiler not supported anymore.
- Moved G4ParticleTypes.hh to particles/management/include to remove
  dependency over particles category.

  categories. Dependency over intercoms to be fixed still.

December 1, 98 M.Nagamatu, H Yoshida
- G4ios.cc guarded by G4STREAM

November 27, 98 M.Asai
- G4UnitsMessenger has been moved to intercoms category to avoid a loop dependency.

November 12, 98 K. Amako (global-00-03-05)

  constructors.

November 6, 98 J.Allison (global-00-03-04)

- Fixed initialization of G4UnitDefinition::UnitsMessenger in
  G4UnitesTable.cc.

October 17, 98 H.Kurasige
- Modified G4FastVector.hh:
  new array is now created only if (items > N) in Initialize() method
  (in old version new array was created even when items are equal to N).

October 13, 98  M.Nagamatu (global-00-03-01)
- Added extern ostream G4cout/G4cerr under G4STREAM control.

October 13, 98 M.Maire

- Replaced definition of min/max/sqr/abs with inclusion of
  CLHEP/config/TemplateFunctions.h. Now compliant with CLHEP-1.3.

  engine of the generator. This obviates to a silly bug in the AIX compiler
  when treating static objects via -qtwolink option.

September 10, 98 G.Cosmo
- Added #undef min/max/sqr/abs to prevent possible macros definition
  (temporary solution to allow backward compatibility with CLHEP-1.2).

  repository $G4TEMPLATE_REPOSITORY used to build libraries becomes read-only
  $G4TEMPEXEC_REPOSITORY is used instead.
