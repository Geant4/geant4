  when adjoint particles reenter the adjoint source. 
  Reput the Nan test removed in  tracking-V09-02-05 but now as (x<0 && x>=0).
  This Nan test is still needed in very rare case where the weight of a
  particle goes to Nan. As such the code is stable! The reason for the Nan
  weight is till under investigation.

Dec 06, 01 G.Cosmo (tracking-V03-02-05)
- G4SteppingVerbose.cc: removed trigraph warning on Linux-g++.

Nov 27, 01 J.Apostolakis (tracking-V03-02-04)
  Correction to the use the touchable Handle for secondary tracks,
       when it is available.
  Now the direction is used in locating a particle (primary or
   secondary) in SetInitialStep. This is in order to assist in 
   starting particles that are on/near-to boundaries in the correct
   volume. 

Nov 27, 01 J.Apostolakis (tracking-V03-02-03)
  Initial step now uses the touchable Handle of the secondary track, 
when it exists and is valid.
  
  To be useful this tag depends the tag track-V03-02-07,
   which enables touchable handles in secondaries.

Nov 08, 01 G.Cosmo (tracking-V03-02-02)
- Introduced changes for reference-counted touchables (T.Sasaki).

- G4SteppingManager.cc: explicitly initialise values to zero in STL
  collections fSelectedAtRestDoItVector, fSelectedAlongStepDoItVector, and
  fSelectedPostStepDoItVector in G4SteppingManager default constructor.
  This overcomes warnings detected on HP-aCC.

  Angle brackets should be used for inclusion of RW classes!

July  1, 98 K. Amako
- Tag for tracking-00-07-02. This includes the following features.
- Because J. Apostolakis changed  the way to calcluate safety in the 
  transportation AlongStepGPIL, the way to set safety of the PostStepPoint
  was modified. Except the first step, the safety of the PreStepPoint
  is also valid in this scheme.
- The coherent energy cut scheme is implemented. This means that 
  the energy of a secondary particle is checked against the energy
  cut value and also safety. Also the 'GoodForTracking' flag is 
  checked. A warning message will be issued if a secondary particle
  has illegal status (i.e. below energy cut and 'GoodForTracking' is off).
  Because processes don't set properly the 'GoodForTracking' yet, this
  waning message is temporary suppressed in the current tag.

June 22, 98 J.Apostolakis 

- Added fix to implementation of new scheme of 'Safety'.

June 16, 98 P.Urban                      -- recorded by J. Apostolakis

- Added changes for tracking optimisation.  (Merged from branch)
- tagged tracking-00-06-03.

June 11, 98 G.Cosmo (tracking-00-06-02)
- Tagged tracking-00-06-02.
  Includes changes by P.Mora de Freitas and M.Asai which were missing in
  the previous tag.

June 6, 98  M.Asai
- GNUmakefile is modified to correspond to the new "digits+hits" structure.

Jun  3, 98  P.Mora de Freitas/M.Verderi
- Implement new scheme of 'Safety' where it becomes the 'range within 
  the assumptions of all processes are valid'. In the G4SteppingManager
  GetPIL loop the safety becomes "competitive" like the step limitation. 
  This means that at the begining of every step the G4SteppingManager 
  will initialize it to DBLMAX and that processes can only decrease it.

May 22, 98  T.Sasaki
- Verbose codes are separated from SteppingManager. 2 files are aded.
April 21, 98 G.Cosmo (tracking-00-05-01)
- Tagged.

April 12, 98 H.Kuraashige
- Implement new scheme of 'Particle Change'. Please see 
  particle_change.asc in geant4alpha/documents/particles+matter/.
  G4SteppingManager.hh,  .cc have been modified.

April 9, 98 G.Cosmo
- Porting on DEC-cxx 6.0.
  Removed meaningless usage of "const" qualifier from functions
  return type for basic types by value. Modified files: G4Trajectory.hh

March 18, 1998 K. Amako
  Add following information to G4Track: 
     1.Momentum direction at the start point (vertex position) of the track 
     2.Kinetic energy at the start point (vertex position) of the track 
     3.Pointer to the process which created the current track 
  Due to this, the following files have modififed and committed.
     1.NewDesignDoc.txt 
     2.G4Track.hh, G4Track.cc 
     3.G4SteppingManager.cc 

January  29, 97 K. Amako
  Following changes have been done and committed/tagged to cvs.
  Tag# is tracking-00-03-01. 
    - G4SteppingManager.cc: Corrected so that the verbose 
      'AlongStepDoItAllDone' is invokded after the 'safety' update.
    - G4SteppingManager.cc: Added a comment in the 'G4Step Information' 
      table of the verbose output of 'AlongStepDoIt (process by process)' 
      so that 'safety' value in it is not updated yet.
    - G4TrackingMessanger.cc: Help for verbose has been updated.
  

December 19, 97 G. Cosmo - (alpha03)

- Created.
