                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

May, 18th, 2007         G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V08-03-01)
- Use kAngTolerance from G4GeometryTolerance class.
- Coworks with tag "global-V08-03-03".

May, 11th, 2007         G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V08-03-00)
- Use call to G4GeometryTolerance instead of kCarTolerance constant in
  G4VDivisionParameterisation.
- Requires tag "global-V08-03-00" and related tag set.

June 8th, 2006          G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V08-00-03)
- Added CLHEP namespace to unit tests where missing.

March 7th, 2006         P.Arce  (geomdiv-V08-00-02)
- Revised text in G4Exceptions thrown by various classes.

February 3rd, 2006      G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V08-00-01)
- Cache information about axis of division and provided accessor method
  GetDivisionAxis() in G4PVDivision.

January 10th, 2006      G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V08-00-00)
- Added missing setting of mother-logical pointer in constructors of
  G4PVDivision. Fixes problem report #829.
- Added checks for illegal constructs of G4PVDivision (NULL pointer to
  mother logical and self-placement).
- Fixed check for generic construct in G4ParameterisationPolycone and
  G4ParameterisationPolyhedra: allow it for the automatic replicated instance.

November 16th, 2005     J.Apostolakis  (geomdiv-V07-01-02)
- Adapted to revision of G4VPhysicalVolume that identifies some 
  regular structures: added two methods for G4PVDivision (IsRegularStructure()
  and GetRegularStructureId()).

November 9th, 2005      G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V07-01-01)
- Migration to <sstream> from deprecated <strstream> for the
  unit test ExDivisions.

November 2nd, 2005      G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V07-01-00)
- Protected case of generic construct for G4Polyhedra and G4Polycone
  currently NOT supported for divisions.
- Coworks with tag "geom-specific-V07-01-05".

June 6th, 2005          G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V07-00-00)
- Fixed compilation problems on unit test.

December 2nd, 2004      G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V06-02-02)
- Implemented migration to <cmath> for standard mathematical functions.

August 26th, 2004       G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V06-02-01)
- G4PVDivision.cc: removed unnecessary debub printout in
  CheckAndSetParamenters().

June 15th, 2004         G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V06-02-00)
- Removed unnecessary forward declaration of HepTransform3D from
  G4ParameterisationBox.hh and G4VDivisionParameterisation.hh.

May 17th, 2004          G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V06-01-01)
- Corrected handling of offset in Z for reflection.

May 13th, 2004          G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V06-01-00)
- Added support for reflection of divided volumes (courtesy of I.Hrivnacova):
  o Added concrete istance of division-factory G4PVDivisionFactory
    for the creation of volume divisions on demand.
  o Enhanced unit-test suite "ExDivisions" to support reflections with
    additional input argument for positioning type (normal/reflected).
  o Coworks with tags: geommng-V06-01-00, geomvol-V06-01-00 and
                       geom-bool-V06-01-00.

Nov 19th, 2003          G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V05-02-07)
- Moved verbose output between G4DIVDEBUG compilation flag.

Nov 18th, 2003          P.Arce  (geomdiv-V05-02-06)
- Added divisions in X and Y for G4Para.
- Added divisions in Z for G4Polycone and G4Polyhedra.
- Fixed handling of offsets and added more checks.

Nov 4th, 2003           G.Cosmo  (geomdiv-V05-02-05)
- Fixes in the logic of resetting parameters in ComputeDimension() for
  polycones and polyhedra. Requires tag "geom-specific-V05-02-05".
