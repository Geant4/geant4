       >all< of solids/Boolean

Oct  30,  98   John Apostolakis   geometry-00-03-03
-------------------------------
- New Boolean directory.
- Many fixes in BREPS:
     Deleted StepCopyData from all classes.
     Replaced G4Point, Point3d and Point2d with G4Point3D
     Fixes to BREPSolid for BoundingBoxes

Sept 23rd, 98  John Apostolakis
-------------------------------
- G4Box: changed DistanceToIn to fix new problem. 
- G4ParameterisedNavigation
- G4VoxelNavigation: fixed VoxelSafety computation for the case of the
  middle voxel of a set of equivalent (lowest-level) voxels.

Sept 17th, 98  John Apostolakis    geometry-00-03-01
-------------------------------
- Tag created.

Sept 15th, 98  John Apostolakis
-------------------------------
- In G4ParameterisedNavigation
   i) Corrected ComputeSafety(...) which called ComputeVoxelSafety without
     setting the fVoxelNode & fVoxelNodeNo to the ones at localpoint.
     [ This produced incorrect safeties in some cases & resulted in an
      assertion failure in testT08 because of an unexpected change of volume. ]
  ii) ComputeStep: Fixed assertion check of blocked replica number.

beta01 release
###############################################################################

July 31st, 98  Peter Urban 
-------------------------------
- Several fixes for BREPS.


July 29th, 98  John Apostolakis  (with Stefano Magni)
-------------------------------
- G4BREPSolidPCone.cc : Cylindrical sections were incorrectly placed.
- G4ConicalSurface.cc 
  G4CylindricalSurface.cc: 
    The Inside functions are modified to try to use the Geant-4 tolerance.
     --> must be checked further
       [ The method is used by Intersect of respective surfaces in a
         complicated manner. ]
- G4FConicalSurface.cc
   - Fix to Bounding Box, which was incorrectly centered/placed.
   - Fix to Intersect, to insure that only intersection in Finite extent of 
      Surface are found.

July 28th, 98  John Apostolakis  
-------------------------------
- In the Navigator location, the blocked Volume was not cleared when the
  navigator descended several levels in the tree. This would allows the same
  in another part of the tree to be wrongly blocked.
- In G4ParameterisedNavigation, the identity of the blocked Physical Volume
  was not checked! You would block replica number 3 of your parameterised
  volume although you exited replica number 3 of another volume!
- The above problems combined to allow BlockingList to be called with
  replicaNo = -1, which caused Linux/G++ & HP to dump core on program exit.
  Modified Files:
    G4Navigator.cc
    G4ParameterisedNavigation.cc
- An assignment used to be an equality check by mistake.
  (Probably it was ok because it is redundant)
  Modified Files:
    G4VoxelNavigation.cc

June 26th, 98  John Apostolakis  geometry-00-06-05
-------------------------------
- 1)  Modified check in ComputeStep that pseudo-relocation is within safety:
     i) no check is made is the move is within tolerance as it makes no sense
         - on a boundary it would cause a volume change (where there was none.)
    ii) the Navigator now stores the last safety it calculated (origin, value) 
         and uses it for the calculation of this check.
        This eliminates problems with this check, that produced assertion
	 failure in many example codes.
- 2) NavigationHistory equality operator modified for efficiency (with P.Urban)
- 3) G4Box     Problem in DistanceToIn reporting intersection where there was
               none has been given a more complete solution (V.Grichine)
     G4Sphere  Exception problem fixed.  (V.Grichine)

June 20th, 98  John Apostolakis  geometry-00-06-04
-------------------------------
- 1) I have added a check that any pseudo-relocation made between a
     call to Locate (the true Relocation) and the next call to ComputeStep
     (eg in a PostStepDoIt) is truly within safety.
- 2) The Navigator's ComputeStep method now always returns infinity, when it
     does not limit the step
- 3) G4Tubs.cc: Fixed surface normal (in R) which was not a unit vector.

June 18th, 98  John Apostolakis  
-------------------------------
- In the Navigator:
    1) Fix to allow lateral displacement (within safety) in PostStepDoIts
       without messaging the Navigator.  
    2) A first implementation of LocateGlobalPointWithinVolume
- A fix in NormalNavigation's Compute Step, to allow volumes that are "touched"
  to be tagged as entered.  (Ie, if the step is just long enough to arrive at
  the surface of a volume, the navigator can still enter it quickly.)

June 12th, 98   John Apostolakis (geometry-00-06-03)
-------------------------------
- Candidate fix to BREP PCone, constructing Conical Surfaces using different
  starting point. 
- Fix to ReplicaNavigation to temporarily patch "assertion" problem.

June 10th, 98  John Apostolakis  (geometry-00-06-02)
-------------------------------
- Added a new CSG Solid (G4Hype), a Hyperboloid by rotation        
- Bug fix to G4Box::DistanceToIn (which reported intersection where there 
                                  was none). 
- Bug fix to G4FConicalSurface and G4ConicalSurface to fix G4BREPSolidPCone.
  Correction to  to DistanceToOut of BREPSolid to ensure compatibility with
  convexity assumptions of Navigator

June  8th, 98  John Apostolakis  (geometry-00-06-01)
-------------------------------
- Created a tag for BREPS at the last point before merge with Peter's
  Developments.
  Modified
    G4Navigator       and
    G4NormalNavigation   G4ParameterisedNavigation
    G4ReplicaNavigation  G4VoxelNavigation
  to add ComputeSafety methods. These make a quick estimation of the
  safety and can/should be called for the final point of a step only.

June  3rd, 98  John Apostolakis
-------------------------------
- G4Navigator:
  Added a new new method LocateGlobalPointWithinVolume that serves to notify
  the Navigator that a track has moved to the new Global point 'position'.
  This point must be known to be within the current volume, probably because it
  is withing safety.

May   11th, 98  John Apostolakis
-------------------------------
- G4PVPlacement:
  - Implemented additional (4th) constructor that takes a pointer to a 
    logical mother volume and a G4Transform3D with the solid's rotation.
  - Also added a data member to store whether a RotationMatrix was created.
    This allows us to avoid a small memory leak in use of 2 constructors.

May    8th, 98  John Apostolakis
-------------------------------
- History files created in magneticfield directory for this category.
  It will be used exclusively for the maintenance of information in
  this category. Only what impacts its interaction with the geometry
  (G4PropagatorInField) will be mentioned here.

- History file  has existed in solids/BREPS for slightly more detailed
  changes in that sub-category.

April 29th, 98  John Apostolakis  (geometry-00-05-05)
-------------------------------
- A significant logical error in G4VoxelNavigation::LocateNextVoxel was 
  corrected: the search for the next voxel could ignore voxels at lower levels
- Small changes for DEC in GNUmakefile in BREPS & STEP
   * Removed -cfront option from GNUmakefile for DEC. -cfront
      overrides ANSI standard rules in cxx-6.0.
   * Cleaned up trivial warnings on DEC (Extraneous semicolons).

April 27th, 98  John Apostolakis  (geometry-00-05-04)
-------------------------------
- Tagged

April 24th, 98  Jari Sulkimo       ( recorded by John Apostolakis here)
-------------------------------
- Fixes in BREPs (see solids/BREP/History for details, by author)
   * fixed scope bugs in for loops
   * bug fixes to G4Assembly.cc for STEP file interaction & placed solids 
     creation. 

April 23rd, 98  John Apostolakis  (geometry-00-05-03)
-------------------------------
- Bug fixes to BREP code for Assembly level of STEP files
  (introduced in alpha05)
- Renamed file G4Point3d.hh to G4Point3d.h (because of problems
  on Windows NT in name clash with G4Point3D.hh).

April 22nd, 98  John Apostolakis  (geom-05-02)
-------------------------------
- Tagged.

April 21st, 98  John Apostolakis  (geometry-00-05-01)
-------------------------------
- Added SetAllParameters methods to G4Torus and G4Para.
- All CSG solids now inherit from the new abstract class G4CSGSolid, instead 
  of directly from G4VSolid.
- "const G4double" arguments have been changed to "G4double" for CSG methods.

April 21st, 98  John Allison
-------------------------------
- Slightly relaxed tolerance in G4Trap (for g3tog4).
- Corrected G4BREPSolidPolyhedra.cc for graphics_reps/G4Polyhedron.
- Added void G4Trd::SetAllParameters.
- Also relaxed check in G4Trd::CheckAndSetAllParameters (pdx1>=0, etc.)

April 2, 98 G.Barrand
-------------------------------
- STEP/dirobj.cc : #ifdef WIN32, do not compile opendir and closedir.

March 24, 98 G.Barrand
-------------------------------
- GNUmakefile : MAKESHLIB changed in G4MAKESHLIB

March 13, 98   G.Cosmo (on behalf of S.Giani) - (geometry-00-04-05)
-------------------------------
- Added G4VPVParameterisation.cc including default implementations
  of ComputeSolid() and ComputeMaterial() missing previously (J.Apostolakis).
- Included fixes for aCC compiler in BREPS and STEP (J.Sulkimo, G.Cosmo). 

March  9, 98  J. Apostolakis - (geometry-00-04-04)
-------------------------------
- Small fix to G4BREPSolid.cc which was causing problems on HP-UX.
  (Deleted use of floating point modulo for integers, with Jari S.)
- G4Sphere:    further small corrections. 

March     5, 98    J. Apostolakis - (geometry-00-04-03)
-------------------------------
- Parameterised Volume can now VARY the TYPE of SOLID and/or Material
  by copy number.  PVParameterisation classes can now compute these.
  The Navigator has been modified to compute solid and material, and
  to set them in the associated logical volume
- Now able to process an extra level of STEP files, using new code in
  BREPs  (Jari Sulkimo). 
- Further cleanup of code in BREP category  (Peter Urban). 
- Small modification in solids/STEP/GNUmakefile for Win/NT port (S. Sadilov).

March     4, 98    J. Apostolakis - (geometry-00-04-02)
-------------------------------
- G4Sphere: corrected tests of the phi angle and with tolerance checking
  that compared squares of distances. 
- The World volume can now be split into replicas. This not recommended, but
  the Navigator is now able to handle it.
- Cleanup of code in BREP category (Peter Urban & Jari Sulkimo)

February 16, 98    J. Apostolakis - (geometry-00-04-01)
-------------------------------
- Replicas and parameterised physical-volumes now store the copy number of
  their current copy. (It is valid only for physical volume in the hot tree).
  Navigation routines were modified to enable this.

February  4, 98    J. Apostolakis - (geometry-00-03-02)
-------------------------------
- A few small changes were made to the Magnetic Field classes. 
  This included one that allows it to work without repeatedly
  issuing an unneccessary warning.  
- Small fixes to BREP and STEP parts help in fixing a problem
  with True/false on some platforms.

January 28, 98 S. Sadilov
-------------------------------
- Small modification in GNUmakefile for Win/NT port 

January  26, 98    J. Apostolakis - (geometry-00-03-01)
-------------------------------
- i)  New implementation of G4NavigationHistory using G4NavigationLevel. 
      This implementation allows for very fast copying of G4NavigationHistory, 
      which is required in order to copy G4TouchableHistory.
- ii) Correction in G4ReplicaNavigation.cc in DistanceToOutPhi, influencing 
      replicas divided in phi.

December 19, 97 G. Cosmo - (alpha03)
-------------------------------
- Created.
