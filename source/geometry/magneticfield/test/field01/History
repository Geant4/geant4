summarize all major modifications introduced in the code and keep
track of all tags.

- TEST is DELETED.
  * Directory contents have been copied to examples/extended/field01
    which is now better maintained.  This is now just duplication, 
    and hard to maintain.
  * Source and include files deleted.
  * Only Run files remain, to aid in testing
