This file should be used by the test developer to briefly
summarize all major modifications introduced in the code and keep
track of all tags.

01-Feb-2001
  Added to G4 CVS repository

29-Jan-2001
  Added visualization of trjectories. Somehow does not work.
  Has to be investigated.

28-Jan-2001
  Input macros separated to have one for batch test and one for
  visualization in VRML and one for DAWN.
  Batch macro contains now particle gun setup to shoot consequently
  into all quadrants of the geometry setup.

25-Jan-2001
  Found out the problem with the reset of G4Navigator state.
  After geometry switch the dummy call to G4Navigator method
  LocateGlobalPointAndSetup(...) will reset the navigator's state
  and forces the re-optimization of geometry from the top.

20-Jan-2001
  Finished implmentation of geometry flip-flop from scratch which
  means deleting the whole old geometry and building the new one

14-Dec-2000, Radovan Chytracek
- Created.
