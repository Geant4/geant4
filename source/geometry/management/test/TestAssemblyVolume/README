                            Assembly Volume Test
                            --------------------

The purpose of this test is to excercise the functionality of the G4AssemblyVolume class
and compare it with the geometry created by using of the G4PVPlacements only.

This test provides the possibility to vizualize the geometries either in VRML (see visVRML.mac)
or DAWN (visDAWN.mac).
