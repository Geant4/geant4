// G4VCurvedTrajectoryFilter

// Class description:
//
// Decides which intermediate points on a curved trajectory merit
// being stored. Defines the compromise between accuracy of
// representation of the curved trajectory and memory use.
//
// Derived classes should implement the filtering algorithm in the
// method TakeIntermediatePoint().
//
// IMPORTANT: This class heap allocates vectors of auxiliary points,
// which it does not delete. The vectors must find their way to a
// subclass of G4VTrajectoryPoint, which must take responsibility for
// deleting them.
