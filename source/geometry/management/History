November 15, 2019 Gabriele Cosmo (geommng-V10-05-15)
- Fixed cases of implicit type conversions from size_t to G4int.

November 11, 2019 J.Apostolakis (geommng-V10-05-14)
- G4LogicalVolume: Added method 'ChangeDaughtersType' to change the
  volume type for CharacterisedDaughters.  It enables the user to turn
  over responsibility for navigation in that volume to an external navigator.
  ( This is for use when one or more daughter volumes are created as an
    existing physical volume types (typically G4PVPlacement). )
  It can also be used enable to create a (logical) volume which containts a
  mixture of existing G4-toolkit physical volume types, and user-created
  'external' physical volume (with type code 'kExternal').
  G4 types must be created first, and then ChangeDaughtersType must be called
  to change the mother's attribute to 'kExternal'.
  Note: only one type of sub-navigator will be called to find a track's
  intersection (or the location of a point) in all daughters of one mother
  volume. The sub-navigator chosen will correspond to the volume type assigned.

October 29, 2019 J.Apostolakis (geommng-V10-05-13)
- Use stored volume type for G4LogicalVolume::CharacterisedDaughters,
  after fix to correctly store type of G4PVParameterised volume.
  Requires geomvol-V10-05-07.

October 23, 2019 J.Apostolakis, G.Cosmo (geommng-V10-05-12)
- Revised G4LogicalVolume to cope with 'external' type of physical volumes.
  Note: these revisions are independent and backward compatible.
- Co-works with geomnav-V10-05-11 (external navigation).

October 23, 2019 J.Apostolakis (geommng-V10-05-11)
- Changed G4VPhysicalVolume::VolumeType() to be virtual.
  Preparing for addition of External Navigation, which adds an 'external'
  physical volume type (for use with an External sub-Navigator).
  Note: This is used by G4Navigator's CharacteriseDaughters() method.
  The old method derived this value from response of IsReplicated() 
  virtual method and, in the case of replica/division/parameterised volumes,
  information from a call to the 2nd virtual method ReplicationData.
- G4VPhysicalVolume copy constructor and assignment operator are now 'deleted'.
- Requires and co-works with geomvol-V10-05-05, geomdiv-V10-05-02.

September 14, 2019 E.Tcherniaev (geommng-V10-05-10)

  const iterators, alias using statements.
- Code cleanup and formatting.

- Defined move constructor and move assignment operator for G4AffineTransform.

May 14, 2019 B.Morgan (geommng-V10-05-05)
- Use header-based #define/undef symbols to configure VecGeom replacements
- G4GeomConfig.hh: Generated header configuring #defines using CMake settings
- G4GeomTypes.hh: "Interface" header to support old GNUmake system. All Geant4
  code should #include this rather than the generated header, which is only
  present in CMake mode.
- G4UAdapter.hh: Add inclusion of G4GeomTypes.hh
- See also cmake-V10-05-03

April 23, 2019 G.Cosmo (geommng-V10-05-02)

  for allocation.

October 10, 2018 E.Tcherniaev (geommng-V10-04-06)
- G4VSolid: reimplemented EstimateSurfaceArea() for approximate calculation
  of the surface area of a solid, by estimating volume of a thin shell
  surrounding the surface using Monte-Carlo method; algorithm providing more
  accurate estimation without performance penalty.

  InverseProduct() has been optimised, now it does 36 multiplications instead
  of 45; added methods for inverse transformation: InverseTransformPoint(),
  InverseTransformAxis(), InverseNetRotation() and InverseNetTranslation().

April 24, 2018 E.Tcherniaev (geommng-V10-04-02)
- G4AffineTransform: minor optimisation to multiplication of matrix by vector,
  to make use of temporaries in accessing vector components.

- Revised G4VPVParameterisation:
  + Changed signature of ComputeMaterial(), adding parent touchable pointer.
    This refinement enables easy use of nested parameterisations.

    and to provide their material via new interface class:
      G4VVolumeMaterialScanner* GetMaterialScanner(); 
  + Suppressed temporary G4PhysicalTouchable class in volumes, not needed 
    in the implementation any longer.

November 11, 2005  J.Apostolakis           geommng-V07-01-04

- Fixed problem with previous tag, where version of G4LogicalVolume.cc was
  not correct and untagged.
- G4LogicalVolume::SetVisAttributes(const G4VisAttributes& VA): now creating
  a copy of 'VA' on the heap. Temporary solution, until a proper 'store' for
  visualization attributes will be implemented to take care of the memory
  management.

May 23, 2005  G.Cosmo                      geommng-V07-00-03
- Modified comments in G4VSolid and G4BlockingList to overcome a limitation in

- Added optional boolean argument 'propagate' to GetMass() to avoid
  propagation of computation of masses to the daughter volumes (courtesy

- Added method TotalVolumeEntities() to G4LogicalVolume, returning the
  total number of physical volumes (placed or replicated/parameterised)
  included in the tree represented by the current logical volume.
- Correction in the computation of mass for parameterised volumes.

Nov 12, 2004  G.Cosmo                      geommng-V06-02-04
- Added method GetMass() to G4LogicalVolume, returning the value in absolute
  units of the mass of the logical volume tree. The mass is computed from the
  estimated geometrical volume of each solid and material's density associated
  to the logical volume and its daughters.
  The returned value is cached and can be used for successive calls (default),
  unless recomputation is forced by providing 'true' as the first boolean
  argument in input. Computation should be forced if the geometry setup has
  changed after the previous call. An optional argument to specify a material
  is provided; it is implicitely used for geometrical parameterisations by
  material.

Oct 10, 2004  J.Allison                    geommng-V06-02-03
- Added GetPolyhedron, a smart access function that creates a G4Polyhedron
  on request and stores for future access.  A null pointer means "not
  available".

Sep 28, 2004  M.Asai                       geommng-V06-02-02
- G4Region:
  o Added map for storage of materials/cuts.

  o Added method UpdateMaterial() to refresh a material/cut couple in
    the corresponding region.

Sep 22, 2004  G.Cosmo                      geommng-V06-02-01
- Introduced virtual method GetCubicVolume() to G4VSolid, returning an
  estimation of the solid volume in internal units. This method may be
  overloaded by derived classes to compute the exact geometrical
  quantity for solids where this is possible, or anyway to cache the
  computed value. By default it uses the new protected method
  EstimateCubicVolume(stat, eps) with fixed statistics and error
  accuracy, and does not cache the computed value.

Sep 02, 2004  G.Cosmo                      geommng-V06-02-00
- Introduced abstract class G4VStoreNotifier to be optionally associated
  to stores by the user for the notification of the registration and
  deregistration of objects in the stores.

  for resetting nagivator state in TstVADetectorConstruction.cc.

  o Added utility method GetParamAxis() to retrieve suggested axis for
    optimisation of parametrised geometry.
  o Enhanced BuildReplicaVoxels() to apply 3D voxelisation for non-consuming
    nodes if undefined axis is specified for parametrised volumes. In such
    case, optimisation for parameterised volumes is applied similarly to
    normal placements.
- G4PVReplica.cc: deal with 'kUndefined' EAxis.
- Co-works with "global-V04-00-06".

May 13, 2002  G. Cosmo                     geommng-V04-00-04

    and deregistering pointers. Now destructors of stores will also
    explicitely delete pointers (and therefore allocated volumes/solids)
    dynamically allocated in the user application.
  o Added Clean() static method to volumes/solids stores to explicitely
    delete pointed objects in the stores and clear all entries.

                    G4PhysicalVolumeStore[.hh.cc].
