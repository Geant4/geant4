    and to provide their material via new interface class:
      G4VVolumeMaterialScanner* GetMaterialScanner(); 
  + Suppressed temporary G4PhysicalTouchable class in volumes, not needed 
    in the implementation any longer.

November 11, 2005  J.Apostolakis           geommng-V07-01-04

- Fixed problem with previous tag, where version of G4LogicalVolume.cc was
  not correct and untagged.
- G4LogicalVolume::SetVisAttributes(const G4VisAttributes& VA): now creating
  a copy of 'VA' on the heap. Temporary solution, until a proper 'store' for
  visualization attributes will be implemented to take care of the memory
  management.

May 23, 2005  G.Cosmo                      geommng-V07-00-03
- Modified comments in G4VSolid and G4BlockingList to overcome a limitation in

- Added G4UserLimits pointer to G4Region and added access from G4LogicalVolume.

Dec 02, 2004  G.Cosmo                      geommng-V06-02-08

- Added method TotalVolumeEntities() to G4LogicalVolume, returning the
  total number of physical volumes (placed or replicated/parameterised)
  included in the tree represented by the current logical volume.
- Correction in the computation of mass for parameterised volumes.

Nov 12, 2004  G.Cosmo                      geommng-V06-02-04
- Added method GetMass() to G4LogicalVolume, returning the value in absolute
  units of the mass of the logical volume tree. The mass is computed from the
  estimated geometrical volume of each solid and material's density associated
  to the logical volume and its daughters.
  The returned value is cached and can be used for successive calls (default),
  unless recomputation is forced by providing 'true' as the first boolean
  argument in input. Computation should be forced if the geometry setup has
  changed after the previous call. An optional argument to specify a material
  is provided; it is implicitely used for geometrical parameterisations by
  material.

Oct 10, 2004  J.Allison                    geommng-V06-02-03
- Added GetPolyhedron, a smart access function that creates a G4Polyhedron
  on request and stores for future access.  A null pointer means "not
  available".

    the corresponding region.

Sep 22, 2004  G.Cosmo                      geommng-V06-02-01
- Introduced virtual method GetCubicVolume() to G4VSolid, returning an
  estimation of the solid volume in internal units. This method may be
  overloaded by derived classes to compute the exact geometrical
  quantity for solids where this is possible, or anyway to cache the
  computed value. By default it uses the new protected method
  EstimateCubicVolume(stat, eps) with fixed statistics and error
  accuracy, and does not cache the computed value.

Sep 02, 2004  G.Cosmo                      geommng-V06-02-00
- Introduced abstract class G4VStoreNotifier to be optionally associated
  to stores by the user for the notification of the registration and
  deregistration of objects in the stores.

- G4PVReplica.cc:
  o Corrected order for check on illegal constructions, in constructor taking
    a pointer to logical volume as mother volume.
  o Improved output diagnostics.
- G4PVParameterised.cc:
  o Improved output diagnostics for check on illegal constructions.

October 16, 2002  G. Cosmo                 geommng-V04-01-01
- G4PVReplica.cc, G4PVParameterised.cc:
  Added checks for illegal geometry contructions; contructors now verify unicity
  of daughter volumes for replicas and parameterised volumes, as well as checks
  for attempt to replicate/parameterise the world volume.

October 4, 2002  G. Cosmo
- G4PVParameterised[.hh.cc], G4PVPlacement[.hh.cc]:
  Added new method IsParameterised() to enquire for existing parameterisation
  for a placed volume.
- G4PVReplica[.hh.cc], G4VPhysicalVolume[.hh.cc]:

  parameterisation of placed volume, and number of replicated volumes.

September 11, 2002  G. Cosmo               geommng-V04-01-00
- G4AssemblyVolume[.hh.icc.cc]:
  o Fixed bug #409 concerning missing imprint counter method.
  o Fixed bug #410 concerning the internal counting mechanism.
    The fix involved the addition of a new data member fAssemblyID,
    holding the instance ID of the given object derived from
    class-wide counter. Corresponding accessor methods has been
    added as well.
- Updated unit test TestAssemblyVolume, to add call to G4RunManager
  for resetting nagivator state in TstVADetectorConstruction.cc.

June 24, 2002  G. Cosmo                    geommng-V04-00-08
- G4AssemblyVolume[.hh.cc]:
  o Moved accessors to assembly counters to public.

  Fixes problem report #382.

June 7, 2002  G. Cosmo                     geommng-V04-00-07
- G4AssemblyVolume[.hh.cc]:
  o Fixed inconsistent handling of input rotation matrices by caching them
    with corresponding deallocation at destruction time.
    Comments updated accordingly with a warning about foreseen changes
    in methods' interfaces expected by next major release 5.0.
  o Correctly handle cases when pointer to rotation matrix is zero.
  o Updated unit test.

May 17, 2002  G. Cosmo                     geommng-V04-00-06
- Added ability to optionally optimise/non-optimise detector regions
  using logical volumes:
  o G4LogicalVolume:
    - Introduced additional bool argument to constructor,
      set to 'true' by default.
    - Added method IsToOptimise() with corresponding bool flag attribute.
  o G4GeometryManager:
    - Adapted BuildOptimisations() method to consider optional optimisation
      flag from G4LogicalVolume.

May 15, 2002  G. Cosmo                     geommng-V04-00-05
- G4SmartVoxelHeader:
  o Added utility method GetParamAxis() to retrieve suggested axis for
    optimisation of parametrised geometry.
  o Enhanced BuildReplicaVoxels() to apply 3D voxelisation for non-consuming
    nodes if undefined axis is specified for parametrised volumes. In such
    case, optimisation for parameterised volumes is applied similarly to
    normal placements.
- G4PVReplica.cc: deal with 'kUndefined' EAxis.
- Co-works with "global-V04-00-06".

May 13, 2002  G. Cosmo                     geommng-V04-00-04

- G4GeometryManager: added method IsGeometryClosed() for detecting geometry
  closed or open.
- G4LogicalVolumeStore, G4PhysicalVolumeStore, G4SolidStore: added protection
  to Clean() method for checking if geometry is closed.

  Affected files: G4DrawVoxels[.hh.cc], G4SmartVoxelNode[.hh.cc],
                  G4SmartVoxelProxy[.hh.cc], G4VoxelLimits[.hh.cc].
- Enhanced behavior for destructors of volumes/solids stores.
  o Added locking mechanism for preventing conflicts when destroying stores
    and deregistering pointers. Now destructors of stores will also
    explicitely delete pointers (and therefore allocated volumes/solids)
    dynamically allocated in the user application.
  o Added Clean() static method to volumes/solids stores to explicitely
    delete pointed objects in the stores and clear all entries.
  o Modified files: G4LogicalVolumeStore[.hh.cc], G4SolidStore[.hh.cc],
                    G4PhysicalVolumeStore[.hh.cc].
