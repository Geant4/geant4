This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

Oct, 28th 2002 M.Dressel cand-01-geombias-V05-00-00
     - moving interfaces G4VCellScorer and G4VCellScorerStore back
 

Oct, 22th 2002 M.Dressel internal_7_geombias-V04-01-01
     - renaming G4VPScorer to G4VScorer and  
                G4PStep to G4GeometryCellStep 
     - moving interfaces G4VCellScorer and G4VCellScorerStore to intercoms
     - adding comments 

Oct. 16th 2002 M.Dressel internal_6_geombias-V04-01-01
     - changes recomanded by codewizard
     - stream, and string conversion from file G4Nsplit_Weight.hh/.cc
       to G4StringConversion.hh/.cc

Oct. 15th 2002 M.Dressel
     removing G4Pstring with G4StringConversion

Oct. 14th 2002 M.Dressel 
     cleanup according to codewizzard

Oct. 10th 2002 M.Dressel geombias-V04-01-01-internal-5
     change in G4(V)ImportanceAlgorithm, G4ImportanceSplitExaminer
     G4ImportanceFinder: give pre and post importance 
     separatly insted only ipre/ipost.

Sep, 2th 2002 M.Dressel geombias-V04-01-01-internal-4
     moved files concerning messaging a importance geometry to
     /afs/cern.ch/user/d/dressel/G4/IGeoMessangers.
     Support will be given on demand. 

Sep, 2th 2002 M.Dressel geombias-V04-01-01-internal-3
     code cleanup for code-wizard

Aug,  29th 2002 M.Dressel int-2-geombias-V04-01-01
     renaming of G4PTouchableKey to G4GeometryCell 
     changing  G4VIStore and G4IStore 
     and dependants

Aug,  13th, 2002 M.Dressel
  removed G4VPrintableScorer.hh G4VPrintableScorerFactory.hh

Aug,  13th, 2002 M.Dressel - geombias-V04-01-01
    added G4VCellScorer.hh and G4VCellScorerStore.hh

July, 18th, 2002 M.Dressel 
   change the strategy for importance sampling:
	- G4VIStore: new function:
		IsKnown(const G4PTouchableKey &ptk)
		to tell if a cell (G4PTouchableKey) is known in the
		store
	- no biasing is applied between cells that are not known by 
	  the G4IStore and it's neighbors.
	- importance valu 0 is allowed to flag that no biasing should
	  be done betweeen the cell and it's neighbors.
    change the G4PArallelNavigator: 
        - using G4TouchableHanle
        - and LocateGlobalPointAndSetup

	  
July, 11th, 2002 M.Dressel 
  added comments in new classes

July, 11th, 2002 M.Dressel - internal-2-geombias-V04-01-01
  added clases for contruction of a simple geometry with 
  importance values and messengers.

July, 10th, 2002 M.Dressel - internal-1-geombias-V04-01-01
 change in G4Sigma: the sum over the weights is returned by GetWsum 
 (before it was GetSumOfWeights) and the weighted sum over x is returned  
 by GetWXsum().
