March 7th, 2017 A.Howard (geombias-V10-03-00)
- Added mutex locks to methods within G4IStore and G4ImportanceAlgorithm

  crashing if bounds-checking was switched on (with many threads+events)

March 10th, 2015 G.Cosmo (geombias-V10-01-00)
- Made G4IStore and G4WeightWindowStore singletons thread-local to avoid

November 9th, 2007 A.Howard geombias-V09-00-00
     - Modified WeightWindow algorithm according to Thomas Booth's
       recommendation (MCNP author). In order to not introduce extra variance 
       in the case of splitting to the survival weight when the weight is 
       above the upper weight window - modified G4WeightWindowAlgorithm.cc

June 4th, 2007 A.Howard geombias-V08-03-02
     - Put back some missing store and scoring classes:
       G4IStore, G4VCellScorerstore, G4VCellScorer

May 31st, 2007 A.Howard geombias-V08-03-01
     - Removed classes from old biasing scheme.  These are now replaced by
       either CoupledTransportation (parallel navigation) or in 
       processe/biasing.  In addition the scoring is implemented with the new
       scoring frame-work (digits_hits) and processes/scoring.
     - The following classes are removed:
       G4IStore, G4ParallelNavigator, G4ParallelStepper, G4ParallelWorld,
       G4VCellScorer, G4VCellScorerStore, G4VIStore, G4VParallelStepper, 
       G4VPGeoDriver, G4VScorer, G4ImportanceSplitExaminer, 
       G4VImportanceSplitExaminer, G4VWeightWindowExaminer,
