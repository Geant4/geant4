                      -------------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all directory-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

May 23, 2014  T.Nikitina                  geom-usolids-V09-06-15
- Fixed DistanceToOut() for UTubs, UCons, USphere, UVSCGfaceted and UPolycone, 
  DistanceToOut() return normal even for concave faces.
- Fixed DistanceToOut() for UPolycone in case of points starting on
  the Surface or on the Internal Surface. Improved convexity algorithm in 
  DistanceToOut() for UPolycone for points leaving +/-Dz. 

March 27, 2014  G.Cosmo                   geom-usolids-V09-06-14
- Removed unused SaveVectorToExternalFile() methods in UUtils, also
  causing cyclic dependency with UVector3.

March 25, 2014  T.Nikitina
- Fix to DistanceToIn() for UBox in case of points located on edges.

March 13, 2014  G.Cosmo
- Fixed use of inline keyword for methods defined in .cc files in UTrd,
  UVCSGfaceted and UVoxelizer.
- Moved findComponentFastest() to be a method of UVoxelizer and changed
  to FindComponentFastest().

March 5, 2014  G.Cosmo
- Fixed handling of polyhedron pointer in G4USolid.

February 28, 2014  T.Nikitina
- New Implementation of SafetyFromInside() for UPolycone, skipping internal
  Z sections.
- Implementation of auxiliary methods in UTubs and UCons: SafetyFromInsideR(),
  SafetyFromOutsideR(),SafetyToPhi(). These methds are used in Polycone for
  SafetyfromInside() calculations. SafetyFromInside() and SafetyFromOutside()
  are changed in order to avoid duplications.
  
February 21, 2014  T.Nikitina             geom-usolids-V09-06-13
- Implemented precise safety in UTubs and UCons for SafetyFromOutside().
  Precise safety is used in UPolycone for calculation of SafetyFromOutside().
- UPolycone fixes: added validity check of shape for case when RMin > RMax;
  moved global bounding-box to be a class data member.
  Corrected implementation of DistanceToOut(p,v) for convexity and normals.
  Corrected implementation of DistanceToOut(p,v) for stuck tracks due to
  DistanceToIn=DistanceToOut=0.
  Corrected implementation of Inside() in case of OpenPhi.    

February 12, 2014  G.Cosmo                geom-usolids-V09-06-12
- Removed ResetPolyhedron() from G4USolid bridge class. Not necessary as
  using mutable pointer for solids. Moved 'fPolyhedron' pointer to protected.

February 12, 2014  G.Cosmo
- Corrected implementation of Clone() method in UBox, UTet, UTrd.
- Corrected cloning mechanism and copy constructor in G4USolid.
  Addressing problem report #1553.

January 10, 2014  T.Nikitina
- Fixed typo in SafetyFromInside() for UTubs for correct calculation of
  'safePhi'.

November 29, 2013  G.Cosmo                geom-usolids-V09-06-11
- Corrected library name in GNUmakefile and fixed comment in sources.cmake.

November 21, 2013  G.Cosmo                geom-usolids-V09-06-10
- Fixed compilation warning for type conversion in UVCSGfaceted
  constructor.

November 20, 2013  T.Mikitina             geom-usolids-V09-06-09
- Fixed Coverity defects.

November 14, 2013  T.Mikitina             geom-usolids-V09-06-08
- Corrected visualization methods in bridge G4USolid.
- Corrected returned type string from USolids and added Reset()
  method to UPolycone.

November 13, 2013  G.Cosmo                geom-usolids-V09-06-07
- Removed useless dependency on UMultiUnion in UPolycone.

November 13, 2013  G.Cosmo                geom-usolids-V09-06-06
- Leave out UMultiUnion, as not yet ready for release.

November 12, 2013  T.Nikitina             geom-usolids-V09-06-05
- Corrected passing of parameters for normal in G4USolid::DistanceToOut(p,v).

November 7, 2013  G.Cosmo                 geom-usolids-V09-06-04
- Moved wrappers to associated modules.
- Added missing accessor method to UTrd.

November 5, 2013  G.Cosmo                 geom-usolids-V09-06-03
- Code cleanup and added banners to USolids files.

November 1, 2013  G.Cosmo                 geom-usolids-V09-06-02
- Fixed compilation error and warnings on SLC6.

November 1, 2013  G.Cosmo                 geom-usolids-V09-06-01
- Added wrappers for Ubox, Ucons, UGenericPolycone, UMultiUnion, UOrb,
  UPolycone, UPolyhedra, USphere, UTet, UTrd, UTubs.
  Removed all other shapes not covered by the wrappers (will be included
  in a later stage).
- Updated CMake script accordingly.

October 29, 2013  G.Cosmo                 geom-usolids-V09-06-00
- Imported classes from the AIDA Unified Solids Library
  (see https://aidasoft.web.cern.ch/USolids).
  Shapes provided: Ubox, Ucons, UGenericPolycone, UMultiUnion, UOrb,
  UPolycone, UPolyhedra, USphere, UTet, UTrd, UTubs (including also
  shapes not foreseen to be wrapped as first stage).
- Includes bridge class G4USolid and first wrapper class G4UBox.
