13/02/2002 : R. Chytracek      breps-V04-00-02
- Bug fix #354, G4BREPSolidPolyhedra:
  o Added new private method for creation of planar surfaces gained
    after code refactoring in constructor.
  o Fixed bug for problem report #354 by adding the code handling the cases
    where user supplies for the same z-section different RMIN or RMAX values.
  o This is temporary commit as there is still the problem when user asks for
    polyhedra phi segment and z[a] > z[a+1]. This leads to a wrong surface.

12/02/2002 : R. Chytracek
- Bug fixes of G4BREPSolidPolyhedra:
  o Added enhancement allowing to define RMIN and RMAX to be zero with the
    exception of forbidden two consecutive zero RMAX values.

    trapezoidal and triangular side planes of G4BREPSolidPolyhedra.

  in G4FPlane + fixes in constructor and ComputePlanarSurface helper
  method.
- Fixed first constructor of G4FPlane which now takes another argument
  for setting explicitly the sense of a surface if required.

- Updated BREPSolidPCone unit test.

16/01/2001 : R. Chytracek        breps-V04-00-00
- G4BREPSolidPCone: bugfix for problem report #320.
  o Fixed missing use-case in constructor when RMAX and RMIN have been
    changed for 2 consecutive equal z-values. Now it creates correctly
    2 planar surfaces as expected.
  o Along with that added private method ComputePlanarSurface() gained
    by refactoring of some part of the code in the constructor.
  o Added useful comments analysing problems with planar surfaces and
    showing possible use-cases + some cosmetics.

01/08/2001 : R. Chytracek        breps-V03-02-03
- G4BREPSolidPolyhedra.cc: fixed situation when phi1 = 0 dphi1 = 2*pi and
  all RMINs = 0.0. In this case the inner planes are not created.
  More than 2 z-planes and inner planes are not created whenever two
  consecutive RMINs are = 0.0.

        (rather than the tolerance).          And used <=, instead of <.
 G4FPlane.cc(1.5): 
        Corrected the use of the tolerance in the intersect function
 G4SurfaceBoundary.cc(1.4): Return 1 by convention if on surface.


25/05/1999 : S. Magni
 G4BREPSolidPCone.cc v1.12: 
	New version of Inside function, 
      	     that uses first intersection & dot prod with normal 
             (instead of counting the number of distinct intersections)


21/05/1999 : J. Apostolakis       breps-01-00-02
 Tagged.


21/05/1999 : S. Magni
 G4BREPSolidPCone: Further minor corrections several methods
        - protecting HowNear with fabs when cheching against tolearance ..


21/05/1999 : J. Apostolakis
 G4BSplineSurface.hh,
 G4PointRat.hh,
 G4BREPSolid.cc,
 G4ProjectedSurface.cc
 G4Surface.cc
 G4BREPSolid.cc
        - changed INFINITY to kInfinity


20/05/1999 : S. Giani
 G4Line.cc:
        - A preliminary fix to avoid 0-lenght segments has been introduced.


19/05/1999 : S. Magni
 G4BREPSolidPCone: Corrected several methods 
        - constructor          to take into account the changed G4FPlane 

	- Inside
	- SurfaceNormal
	- DistanceToIn( p, v)
	- DistanceToOut( p, v) 
            for 
                corrected behaviour of HowNear, which is for finite surfaces.
		...
 G4FCylindricalSurface, 
 G4FConicalSurface.cc: 
        Corrected the following methods:
	- Intersect
	- HowNear


12/05/1999 : S.Giani  
 G4BREPSolidPolyhedra Corrections by S.Giani:
        - Xaxis now corresponds to phi=0
        - partial angle = phiTotal / Nsides
        - end planes exact boundary calculation for phiTotal < 2pi 
           (also including case with RMIN=RMAX) 
        - Xaxis now properly rotated to compute correct scope of vertixes
        - corrected surface orientation for outer faces parallel to Z
        - completed explicit setting of the orientation for all faces
        - some comparison between doubles avoided by using tolerances. 

  G4FPlane corrections 
	- The constructor using iVec now properly stores both the internal
	  and external boundaries in the bounds vector.
	- Proper initialization of sameSense in both the constructors. 
	- Addition of third argument (sense) in the second constructor 
	  to ensure consistent setting of the normal in all the client code.



27/01/1999 : L. Broglia ( new tag : breps-01-00-01 )
 - functions Inside, DistanceToIn and DistanceToOut
   are re-written to satisfy requirements

 - these functions are identical into G4BREPSolid
   and into G4BREPSolidPCone & Polyhedra because
   there are general (see ToDo.txt)

 - corrections of G4BREPSolid::CalculExtent by
   Stefano Magni 



14/01/1999 : L. Broglia
 - modification of the IntersectRay2D function

     before : void IntersectRay2D(const G4Ray& ray,  
                                  G4CurveRayIntersection& is)

     now :  G4int IntersectRay2D(const G4Ray& ray)

  return the number of intersections into the curve boundaries,

------------------------------------------------------

December, 1998 : L. Broglia

 - bugs fixed in order to run correctly test05 
   for the first product version 

------------------------------------------------------

November 11, 1998 : L. Broglia

 - correct Inside function for G4SphericalSurface
 - create (but now is empty) Inside function for
   G4CylindricalSurface
 - new implementation into G4CylindricalSurface::Intersect


November 04, 1998  L. Broglia    geometry-00-03-04

- Cleaned up trivial errors on DEC (undefined loop variables).
- Removed old CurveTest, now separate in G4BREPSolidxxxTest files
- Changing the name of the output files. All the tests run correctly with
  Linux, Sun, HP and DEC compilers

Changed

<           HitDistance = closest_point.distance2(RayStart);

to
>           HitDistance = closest_point.distance2((G4Point3D &)RayStart);

   because
              distance2( HepPoint3D &p )
   in CLHEP/Point3D
   should be
              distance2( const HepPoint3D &p )
   as it is const!


October 29, 1998  L. Broglia

 - Changed all the occurences of G4Placement into G4Axis2Placement3D.
 - Modified G4FPlane - new implementation, inheriting from G4Axis2Placement3D
 - Create in G4PointRat INFINITY which is a double and PINFINITY which is a 
   HepVector3D
 - Corrected a bug into G4BREPSolidCylinder
 - Created  a test for the curves
 - Created tests for all BREP solids.
   For the moment, only test for the sphere and test for the torus 
   run correctly
 - Created a test which read a STEP file and created the BREP solid




October 20, 1998  L. Broglia    Breps-lionel-tag1-point3D

- Changed all the occurences of G4Point3d, G4Point2d into G4Point3D, which
