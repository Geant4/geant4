- Cleared compilation warnings on SUN-CC for changes in the last tag.
  Fixed overloaded class variables in G4Polyhedra and G4Polycone
  implementation of CreatePolyhedron().

31-Oct-2006, J.Allison (geom-specific-V08-01-01)
- Implemented CreatePolyhedron() for G4Polyhedra and G4Polycone.

20-Oct-2006, G.Cosmo (geom-specific-V08-01-00)
- Implemented caching mechanism for computation of surface area in
  all solids and base classes, as done for the geometrical volume
  computation.

20-Jun-2006, G.Cosmo (geom-specific-V08-00-10)
- Added accessor method GetVertices() in G4Tet to return the list of
  vertices composing the solid. Required for GDML persistency.

  the origin.

  of uninitialised variables.

- Cleared compilation warning on SUN-CC in G4TriangularFacet.cc.

04-May-2006, G.Cosmo (geom-specific-V08-00-06)
- Use different names for unit tests to avoid confusing liblist ...

03-May-2006, G.Cosmo (geom-specific-V08-00-05)
- Added four unit tests for G4TessellatedSolid.

24-Mar-2006, G.Cosmo (geom-specific-V08-00-04)
- G4TwistedTubs: defined exact estimation for GetCubicVolume(),
  similar to the one adopted for G4Tubs.

03-Mar-2006, G.Cosmo (geom-specific-V08-00-03)
- Corrected boolean condition in G4TriangularFacet::Intersect().
  Use '&&' operator in condition. Allows for porting on WIN32-VC.

- Introducing first implementation of a tessellated solid, contribution
  of P.R.Truscott (QinetiQ Ltd, UK).

- G4TwistedTubs and G4VTwistedFaceted::CreatePolyhedron():
  parameterised polyhedron mesh approximation in terms of
  G4Polyhedron::GetNumberOfRotationSteps().

  o Changed GetPointOnSurface(), which was not uniform in endcaps.
  o Bug fix in Inside(), which was not correct for the elliptic mantel.
    Made test similar as in G4EllipticTube.

    distance was taken, even if 0); now comparing the distance to the endcap
    and to the mantel and decide afterwards which distance is shortest;
    added check n*v.
  o The code is now "good" at 90%. Still 10% wrong reconstructed events.
    e.g there is a problem is DistanceToOut(): missed the intersection
    (reconstruction took the encap instead of the mantel).
