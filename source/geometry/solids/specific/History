- First implementation of a framework for twisted surfaces, integrated from
  the original version of Kotoyo Hoshina (hoshina@hepburn.s.chiba-u.ac.jp)
  implemented in the 'Jupiter' application.
  o Includes new specific twisted shape: G4TwistedTubs.
  o New classes: G4VSurface, G4TwistedSurface, G4HyperbolicSurface,
                 G4FlatSurface, G4TwistedTubs.
  o Cleanup of original code (debugging messages, compiler errors, migration
    of g4std to new convention...)
  o New organisation of class G4TwistedTubs: now independent of XXXSurface;
    removed backpointer 'fSolid' from XXXSurface to G4TwistedTubs.
  o New form of constructors in G4TwistedSurface, G4HyperbolicSurface and
    G4FlatSurface.
  o Change in G4TwistedSurface::DistanceToIn(p,v,...): roundoff correction.

12-Jan-2004, G.Cosmo (geom-specific-V06-00-00)

-----------------------
- G4IntersectingCone.cc: make small adjustment to help with roundoff error
  in LineHitsCone1() and LineHitsCone2().

08-Jan-2001, D.Williams  (geom-solids-specific-V03-00-00)
-----------------------
- G4Hype.cc: Added protecton against zero v.z in DistanceToOut.

20-Nov-2000, G.Cosmo     (geom-solids-specific-V02-00-04)

  o fixed declaration of variables used before being initialised.
  o fixed order of initialisation of member data in constructors.
  o fixed usage of unsigned-int (size_t) for array indeces.

13-Nov-2000, G.Cosmo     (geom-solids-specific-V02-00-03)
--------------------

  went lost by mistake...

02-Nov-2000, G.Cosmo     (geom-solids-specific-V02-00-02)
--------------------
- QA code revision and cleanup (+fixes from CodeWizard filtering):
  o Avoid inline virtual methods.
  o General cosmetics for Software Reference Manual.

23-Oct-2000, D.Williams  (geom-solids-specific-V02-00-01)
-----------------------
- G4IntersectingCone.cc: the check for a zero radical has been adjusted to be
  less sensitive to round off error in LineHitsCone1(), LineHitsCone2().
  This fixes a problem discovered in BaBar.

  Removed struct and replaced with class.

26-Jun-2000, G.Cosmo  (geom-solids-specific-V01-01-01)
--------------------
- G4Polycone.cc: fixed memory leak by invoking destruction of member
  enclosingCylinder, which was not cleaned up in the destructor.
  This fixes problem report #107.
- G4Polycone.hh: added forward declaration of struct G4PolyconeHistorical
  and made it friend, for porting on KCC --strict. This fixes report #110.

  GetNumSide(). This fixes problem report #105.

08-Jun-2000, G.Gracia

27-Apr-2000, G.Cosmo
--------------------
- Removed dependency over the CSG domain in GNUmakefile.

18-Apr-2000, D.Williams
-----------------------
- Removed meaningless "const" specifiers from methods in G4ClippablePolygon,
  and G4EllipticalTube.

  from G4VSolid (before was G4CSGSolid).
- Reintroduced GetExtent() in G4EllipticalTube, G4Hype and G4VCSGfaceted
  (in principle, not needed).
- Modified assertations in unit test testG4Hype.cc.

11-Apr-2000, J.Allison
----------------------
- Removed implementations of GetExtent in most sub-classes of G4VSolid (a
  default implementation exists in G4VSolid).
- All implementations of DescribeYourselfTo (G4VGraphicsScene& scene) const
  now correctly written: scene.AddThis(*this).

05-Apr-2000, G.Cosmo   (geom-solids-specific-V01-01-00)
--------------------
- Restructured solids/CSG domain, by moving to "specific" the following

  G4Polycone, G4PolyconeSide, G4Polyhedra, G4PolyhedraSide, G4ReduciblePolygon,
  G4IntersectingCone, G4SolidExtentList, G4VCSGface, G4VCSGfaceted.
  The new module's library for "specific" is now called 'G4specsolids'.
- Created specific/test directory and moved testG4Hype.cc and testG4Polycone,cc
  from CSG/test.
- Organised class description comments for the Software Reference Manual
  and added CVS headers to files.

29-Mar-2000, D.Williams
-----------------------
- Added first implementation of G4EllipticalTube.
  It defines a simple elliptical tube, as in geant3 "ELTU".
  Files introduced: G4EllipticalTube[.hh.cc].

--------------------
- History file created.
