19-Dec-2005, O.Link (geom-specific-V08-00-00)
- Fixes in G4EllipticalCone:
  o Changed GetPointOnSurface(), which was not uniform in endcaps.
  o Bug fix in Inside(), which was not correct for the elliptic mantel.
    Made test similar as in G4EllipticTube.

    distance was taken, even if 0); now comparing the distance to the endcap
    and to the mantel and decide afterwards which distance is shortest;
    added check n*v.
  o The code is now "good" at 90%. Still 10% wrong reconstructed events.
    e.g there is a problem is DistanceToOut(): missed the intersection
    (reconstruction took the encap instead of the mantel).
