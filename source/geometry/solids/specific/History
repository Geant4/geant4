                      -------------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all directory-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

- Use new polynom approximations based on new solver based on Jenkins-Traub
  algorithm, for twisted-box and twisted-trap.
- Fixed bug in the usage of 'fmod' and adopt special treatment for 'parallel'
  events in G4TwistedBoxSide and G4TwistedTrapSide.
- Coworks with tag "global-V07-00-00".

08-Dec-2004, O.Link (geom-specific-V06-02-07)
- Extensions to twisted box/trap shapes to consider all 4 solutions
  for determining correct intersections.

29-Nov-2004, O.Link (geom-specific-V06-02-06)

                        length a/2,b/2,L/2.
- Added G4TwistedTrap - a twisted trapezoid (still in debug state)
- Changed in G4VSurface.icc:

  methods of nested classes to .cc.

- Fixed compilation problem on SUN-CC. Made EValidate enum public in
  G4VSurface.hh.

  o New classes: G4VSurface, G4TwistedSurface, G4HyperbolicSurface,
                 G4FlatSurface, G4TwistedTubs.
  o Cleanup of original code (debugging messages, compiler errors, migration
    of g4std to new convention...)
  o New organisation of class G4TwistedTubs: now independent of XXXSurface;
    removed backpointer 'fSolid' from XXXSurface to G4TwistedTubs.
  o New form of constructors in G4TwistedSurface, G4HyperbolicSurface and
    G4FlatSurface.
  o Change in G4TwistedSurface::DistanceToIn(p,v,...): roundoff correction.

  o fixed order of initialisation of member data in constructors.
  o fixed usage of unsigned-int (size_t) for array indeces.

13-Nov-2000, G.Cosmo     (geom-solids-specific-V02-00-03)
--------------------
- Added definition of empty constructor for G4ClippablePolygon which
  went lost by mistake...

23-Oct-2000, D.Williams  (geom-solids-specific-V02-00-01)
-----------------------
- G4IntersectingCone.cc: the check for a zero radical has been adjusted to be

  enclosingCylinder, which was not cleaned up in the destructor.

  GetNumSide(). This fixes problem report #105.

08-Jun-2000, G.Gracia

-----------------------
- Removed meaningless "const" specifiers from methods in G4ClippablePolygon,
  and G4EllipticalTube.

  from G4VSolid (before was G4CSGSolid).
- Reintroduced GetExtent() in G4EllipticalTube, G4Hype and G4VCSGfaceted
  (in principle, not needed).
- Modified assertations in unit test testG4Hype.cc.

  G4Polycone, G4PolyconeSide, G4Polyhedra, G4PolyhedraSide, G4ReduciblePolygon,
  G4IntersectingCone, G4SolidExtentList, G4VCSGface, G4VCSGfaceted.
  The new module's library for "specific" is now called 'G4specsolids'.
- Created specific/test directory and moved testG4Hype.cc and testG4Polycone,cc
  from CSG/test.
- Organised class description comments for the Software Reference Manual
  and added CVS headers to files.

29-Mar-2000, D.Williams
-----------------------
