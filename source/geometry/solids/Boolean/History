    result of the calls to fPtrSolidA->Inside() and fPtrSolidB->Inside().
    Corrected debug printout to say 'Point p is *out*side' not inside.
    NOTE: further improvement can be made by creating new method 
            Inside( point, &resultInsideA, &resultInsideB ); 
          which can be called by a 'bare' Inside( point ) method.

  - G4BooleanSolid: added protected data 'fAreaRatio' and related method
    GetAreaRatio() which store the ratio of surface areas of SolidA to
    SolidA+SolidB. The ratio is used in GetPointOnSurface() to better
    approximate uniform coverage. Uniformity cannot be guaranteed in all
    cases and when constituent solids have shared surfaces.

    + 0002: invalid setup/construct;
    + 0003: invalid run condition;
    + 1001: incorrect setup; automatically adapted.
    + 1002: notification.

 July 22, 2011  T.Nikitina                geom-bool-V09-04-01
  - Corrected protection in G4SubtractionSolid::DistanceToIn(p,v) introduced
    in previous tag and relaxed to not cause event abortion.

  - Implemented copy-constructor and assignment operator for concrete
    solids classes to facilitate conversion to Geant4-MT.

 July 7, 2010  G.Cosmo                    geom-bool-V09-03-01
  - Simplified logic in G4UnionSolid::Inside() to exclude obvious
    conditional cases.

 May 11, 2010  J.Allison                  geom-bool-V09-03-00
  - Introduced recursive algorithm in CreatePolyhedron(): it uses
    HepPolyhedronProcessor from 'graphics_reps', which tries small shifts
    in an attempt to avoid numerical problems in the calculation of the
    polyhedron in BooleanProcessor. Recursion allows HepPolyhedronProcessor
    to try all permutations, also for Booleans of Booleans.
    Helps in reducing the number of cases of "Error in Boolean processor" for
    visualization, but still some stubborn cases are left.

 Oct 24, 2007  V.Grichine                 geom-bool-V09-00-00

  - Added GetPolyhedron, a smart access function that creates a G4Polyhedron
    on request and stores for future access.  A null pointer means "not
    available".

 Sep 22, 2004   V.Grichine                geom-bool-V06-02-00

    implementation in destructor of G4BooleanSolid to not call for deletion
    of G4VSolid in the case where displacement is used.
    This fixes a problem noticed on Linux-g++ at application closeout for
    double deletion of a solid in such special case.

 Oct 28  2002  Gabriele Cosmo       geom-bool-V04-01-00
  - Added implementation of StreamInfo() to comply with new interface for
    G4VSolid in "geommng-V04-01-03".

    in problem report #153.

 Mar 19  2001  Gabriele Cosmo       geom-solid-bool-V03-00-03

  - G4IntersectionSolid:
    o fix in CalculateExtent() for computation of pMin and pMax, to avoid
      assignment in case CalculateExtent() of one component solid fails.
    o fix in Inside() to return kOutside in case first component solid's
      Inside() returns kOutside.
  - G4UnionSolid:
    o fix in CalculateExtent() for computation of pMin and pMax: initialised
      local variables.

 Jan 31  2001  Gabriele Cosmo       geom-solid-bool-V03-00-02

  - Fix in G4UnionSolid::DistanceToOut(p,v,...) for assignment of

      SetTransform(G4AffineTransform&),
      SetDirectTransform(G4AffineTransform&),
      SetFrameRotation(const G4RotationMatrix&),
      SetFrameTranslation(const G4ThreeVector&),
      SetObjectRotation(const G4RotationMatrix&),
      SetObjectTranslation(const G4ThreeVector&).

 Nov 20  2000  Gabriele Cosmo       geom-solid-bool-V02-00-02

  - Fixes to remove warnings from "-Wall -ansi -pedantic" g++ compiler options:
    o commented out variables declared and not used.
    o fixed declaration of variables used before being initialised.
    o fixed order of initialisation of member data in constructors.
    o fixed usage of unsigned-int (size_t) for array indeces.

 Nov 2   2000  Gabriele Cosmo       geom-solid-bool-V02-00-01

 Sep 13  2000  Vladimir Grichine    geom-solid-bool-V02-00-00

  - G4SubtractionSolid.cc: relaxed behavior in SurfaceNormal(p), where
    it is allowed for a point to be inside the solid. A message is thrown
    to cerr instead of a G4Exception.

 Jun 26  2000  Vladimir Grichine    geom-solid-bool-V01-01-03

  - Fixed bug in G4SubtractionSolid::DistanceToOut(p,v,...). validNorm
    flag was uncorrectly set to true. Fixes report #102.

 Jun 6   2000  John Apostolakis     geom-solid-bool-V01-01-02

  - Protecting the use of pointers validNorm and n, if calcNorm is false

 Jun 6   2000  John Allison         geom-solid-bool-V01-01-01

  - Re-enabled CreatePolyhedron() method from G4UnionSolid, G4IntersectionSolid
    and G4SubtractionSolid.  Coworks with greps-V01-01-04.

 May 26  2000  John Allison         geom-solid-bool-V01-01-00

  - Disabled CreatePolyhedron() method from G4UnionSolid, G4IntersectionSolid
    and G4SubtractionSolid. It now temporarly returns a NULL pointer.
    Visualisation of Boolean solids is therefore temporarly disabled, pending
    a definitive fix in graphics_reps.
    Files G4UnionSolid.cc, G4SubtractionSolid.cc and G4IntersectionSolid.cc
    are included in the branch-tag "boolean_nopoly_branch".

 Apr 27  2000  Gabriele Cosmo

  - Reorganised comments for the Software Reference Manual.
  - Added CVS headers and standard G4 header where missing.

 Apr 11  2000  John Allison

  - CreatePolyhedron implemented for BooleanSolids.
  - G4DisplacedSolid: reversed implementation of GetFrameRotation and
    GetObjectRotation, removing inappropriate invertion.
  - G4DisplacedSolid::GetConstituentMovedSolid() made const.

 Jan 19  2000	Gabriele Cosmo	    geom-solid-bool-V01-00-00

  - Syncronized file versions with HEAD (essentially CVS headers changes)
  - Fixed cases of G4std::min which were not migrated on the HEAD in files:
    G4UnionSolid.cc and G4IntersectionSolid.cc

 Nov 24  1999 			    geom-solid-bool-V00-01-05

  - Small fix in src/G4DisplacedSolid.cc to the return type 
         (const G4AffineTransform --> G4AffineTransform)
    to conform with the specification of the class.

 Nov 19  1999                       geom-solid-bool-V00-01-04

  -  Fixes from Vladimir, and additional tests

 Nov 10  1999                       geom-solid-bool-V00-01-03b

  - Renamed  GetConstituentSolid to GetConstituentMovedSolid in G4DisplacedSolid
     to avoid clashing with method that gets the contituents of a G4BooleanSolid.

 Nov 10  1999                       geom-solid-bool-V00-01-03a

  - Tag with additional methods for Persistency

 Nov 10  1999                       geom-solid-bool-V00-01-03-cand

  New method: Get Object Rotation/Translation methods in Displaced Solid

 Nov  9  1999                       geom-solid-bool-V00-01-02-cand
  
  - Tag with additional methods for Visualisation

   G4DisplacedSolid,  G4BooleanSolid

      Added methods to access data members:
          Get Constituent Solid  (int) for Boolean   Solid 
          Get Constituent Solid        for Displaced Solid 
          Get Frame Rotation/Translation methods in Displaced Solid
