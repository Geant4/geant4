- Updated implementation of SurfaceNormal(p) to get consistence with 
  Inside(p) functions for the treatment of phi/theta surfaces.
  They are treated now in both functions in terms of kAngTolerance.
  The reason is that historically SurfaceNormal(p) was using only
  kCarTolerance for estimation of shortest distance to a surface. Now,
  following the new updated specification, the surface selection is made
  according to Inside(p) approach (as kSurface is selected), i.e. - for
  phi/theta surfaces in terms of kAngTolerance.

 - G4PolyhedraSide.cc: fixed bug in G4PolyhedraSide::Normal(...).

 - Replaced 1/DBL_MAX with DBL_MIN (valid correction, seen in tests for STL) 
   in G4PolyPhiFace.cc, G4PolyconeSide.cc and G4PolyhedraSide.cc

Apr 29,   99   David Williams
 - G4Polyhedra and G4Polycone (and G4VCSGfaceted) modified:
         1. Implemented correct copy constructors and assignment operators.
         2. Fix some leaks for tracks that pass exactly through an edge. 
            Some leaks still remain: particularly if a track passes through
	     a corner and between the curved edges of G4Polycone.
         3. G4Polyhedra argument numSide changed to G4int (from G4double)

Apr 13,   99   Vladimir Grichine and Simone Giani
 - Minor consistency fix to 8 basic CSG solids: 
   Tolerance used in calculation of extent but not in one place,
   and not another - this tripped up the client code. 

Feb 16,   99   David Williams
 - Repaired bugs in G4Polycone (G4PolyconeSide.cc) as found in
   test/testG4Polycone and missed in below.
 - Updated definition of DistanceToIn(p) and DistanceToOut(p) to
   return zero when the point p is on the surface of the solid.

Feb 12,   99   David Williams
 - src/G4PolyconeSide.cc updated (revision 1.4) to fix a bug discovered by
   test/testG4Polycone.

Feb   9,  99   David C. Williams      (davidw@scipp.ucsc.edu)
 - I've committed new versions of the CSG Polycone and Polyhedra in the
   geant4 repository, including a new utility class called
   G4ReduciblePolygon. The new versions fix several subtle bugs which my  
   "test3" batch geometry testing code uncovered. In addition, the new class
   G4ReduciblePolygon is used to run strict tests on the validity of input
   parameters.
   To fix a bug in Polyhedra, I had to back out some fancy code that
   allowed it to calculate intersections at a speed that was independent of
   the number of sides. The new version now runs at a speed proportional to
   the number of sides, and is thus much slower for polyhedras with many
   sides. I can fix this, but I thought it would be best to get the bug fixes
   in as soon as possible.
