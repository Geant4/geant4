  CLHEP/HepGeom namespaces for CLHEP types.

Oct 23, 2005  V.Grichine                 geom-csg-V07-01-03
- G4Para: fixed bug in DistanceToOut(p,v) for the case v.x()<0.
  Following problem report from user posted on Hypernews (#452).

Jul 25, 2005  O.Link                     geom-csg-V07-01-00
- Fixed bug in G4Sphere::DistanceToOut(p,v):

- Keep old specification for SurfaceNormal() to treat usage of the
  function for points not at the surface.

- G4Para: bug fixed in SurfaceNormal(p) for x-distance, to be now in
  accordance with the surface selection using Inside(p).
- Updated unit test testSurfaceNormal.cc.

May 09, 2005  V.Grichine                 geom-csg-V07-00-04
- Updated implementation of SurfaceNormal(p) to get consistence with 
  Inside(p) functions for the treatment of phi/theta surfaces.
  They are treated now in both functions in terms of kAngTolerance.
  The reason is that historically SurfaceNormal(p) was using only
  kCarTolerance for estimation of shortest distance to a surface. Now,
  following the new updated specification, the surface selection is made
  according to Inside(p) approach (as kSurface is selected), i.e. - for
  phi/theta surfaces in terms of kAngTolerance.

  on request and stores for future access.  A null pointer means "not

 - G4Hype[.hh.cc]: fixed several longstanding issues and bring methods
                   into compliance with specifications  (D.Williams)
 - Moved to "specific" the following classes:
   G4ClippablePolygon, G4EnclosingCylinder, G4Hype, G4PolyPhiFace,
   G4Polycone, G4PolyconeSide, G4Polyhedra, G4PolyhedraSide,
   G4ReduciblePolygon, G4IntersectingCone, G4SolidExtentList,
   G4VCSGface, G4VCSGfaceted.
 - Moved testG4Hype.cc and testG4Polycone.cc from CSG/test to
   specific/test
 - Moved generic tests "SBT" and "Fred" one level up to solids/test.
 - Organised class description comments for the Software Reference Manual
   in all headers.

 - G4PolyhedraSide.cc: fixed bug in G4PolyhedraSide::Normal(...).
   The method Normal(...) (used by G4VCSGfaceted::SurfaceNormal) was not
   filling in the argument bestDistance. This fixes a bug observed in
   G4Polyhedra::SurfaceNormal.

 - Added diagnostics in G4Cons, G4Sphere and G4Torus in function
   DistanceToOut(p,v,...).

 - Minor fixes to unit tests to make them up-to-date with recent
   development versions (already included in tag geometry-V01-00-00a).
 - G4PolyconeSide.cc, G4PolyhedraSide.cc: added explicit cast to G4int
   to avoid warnings on Linux.

Jan 19,   00   G. Cosmo			  geom-solids-csg-01-00-04
 - Fixed bug in DistanceToIn(p,v). Modified files: G4Trap.cc and
   testG4Trap.cc. (V.Grichine)
 - Syncronized file versions with HEAD (essentially CVS headers changes).
 - Fixes for missing migration on HEAD related to some files in test/fred
   and test/SBT.

 - Added initialisation to Eside "side" variable in DistanceToOut(p,v)
   in CSG solids   -->   Problem report from D.C. Williams, BaBar
 - A check in G4Trap Makeplane added.

   G4IntersectingCone.cc, G4PolyconeSide.cc and G4VCSGfaceted.cc
   and to  test/SBT/SBT.cc  and  test/SBT/polycone.geant4

 - Replaced 1/DBL_MAX with DBL_MIN (valid correction, seen in tests for STL) 
   in G4PolyPhiFace.cc, G4PolyconeSide.cc and G4PolyhedraSide.cc

Apr 29,   99   David Williams
 - G4Polyhedra and G4Polycone (and G4VCSGfaceted) modified:
         1. Implemented correct copy constructors and assignment operators.
         2. Fix some leaks for tracks that pass exactly through an edge. 
            Some leaks still remain: particularly if a track passes through
	     a corner and between the curved edges of G4Polycone.
         3. G4Polyhedra argument numSide changed to G4int (from G4double)

 - Minor consistency fix to 8 basic CSG solids: 
   Tolerance used in calculation of extent but not in one place,
   and not another - this tripped up the client code. 

Feb 16,   99   David Williams
 - Repaired bugs in G4Polycone (G4PolyconeSide.cc) as found in
   test/testG4Polycone and missed in below.
 - Updated definition of DistanceToIn(p) and DistanceToOut(p) to
   return zero when the point p is on the surface of the solid.

Feb 12,   99   David Williams
 - src/G4PolyconeSide.cc updated (revision 1.4) to fix a bug discovered by
   test/testG4Polycone.

Feb   9,  99   David C. Williams      (davidw@scipp.ucsc.edu)
 - I've committed new versions of the CSG Polycone and Polyhedra in the
   geant4 repository, including a new utility class called
   G4ReduciblePolygon. The new versions fix several subtle bugs which my  
   "test3" batch geometry testing code uncovered. In addition, the new class
   G4ReduciblePolygon is used to run strict tests on the validity of input
   parameters.
   To fix a bug in Polyhedra, I had to back out some fancy code that
   allowed it to calculate intersections at a speed that was independent of
   the number of sides. The new version now runs at a speed proportional to
   the number of sides, and is thus much slower for polyhedras with many
   sides. I can fix this, but I thought it would be best to get the bug fixes
   in as soon as possible.
