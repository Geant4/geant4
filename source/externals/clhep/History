# History entries prior to 11.0

01 September 2021 - G.Cosmo
- Synchronised with CLHEP-2.4.5.1.
  * Random (J.Hahnfeld)
    o Introducing new random engine RANLUX++ and related helper classes.
      RANLUX++ is an extension of RANLUX and uses the equivalent LCG to
      offer a much higher luxury level at better performance. It inherits
      the excellent statistical properties and passes the full BigCrush.

07 July 2021 - G.Cosmo
- Random (J.Hahnfeld)
  o Fixed seeding in Ranlux64Engine.

28 May 2021 - G.Cosmo
- Synchronised with CLHEP-2.4.4.2.

07 May 2021 - G.Cosmo
- Units (M.Maire)
  o Added in SystemOfUnits.h: minute, hour, day, year and millielectronvolt.
  o Added in PhysicalConstants.h: Bohr_magneton and nuclear_magneton.

06 May 2021 - G.Cosmo
- Random (G.Cosmo)
  o Fixed trivial compilation warnings on gcc-11 in Random headers.

11 November 2020 - G.Cosmo
- Synchronised with CLHEP-2.4.4.0:
  * Vector (G.Amadio)
    o Removed obsolete #pragma interface/implementation
      These pragmas are obsolete since GCC 2.7.2.
      https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/C_002b_002b-Interface.html.
    o Get rid of switch statement in operator()/operator[] of Hep3Vector
      Replaced dx/dy/dz with operator[] in Hep3Vector
      Note: The substitution of x()/y()/z() in operator() is necessary to
            avoid infinite recursion, as x()/y()/z() are now defined in terms
            of operator[] instead.
    o Replaced private dx/dy/dz with public x()/y()/z() in Hep3Vector
      This is in preparation to change the data layout of Hep3Vector
      by replacing the private dx/dy/dz members with a vector, data[3],
      to allow us to remove the inefficient switch from operator[]().
  * Vector, Random (V.Vassilev)
    o Added missing includes for translation unit encapsulation.

17 July 2020 - G.Cosmo
- Updated values in SystemOfUnits.h and PhysicalConstants.h for:
  - e_SI, electron charge
  - h_Planck, Planck constant
  - Avogadro, Avogadro constant
  - k_Boltzmann, Boltzmann constant
  based on May 2019 redefinition of SI units. References:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_redefinition_of_the_SI_base_units

- Updated to CLHEP-2.3.4.4.
- Fix in HepRotation::axis() for proper treatment of degenerating cases.
- Fixed compilation warnings on gcc-7.1 in Evaluator.cc.

03 February 2017 - B.Morgan (clhep-V10-03-00)
- Set interface include directories on G4clhep{-static} targets
  in CMakeLists.txt. This provides the needed interface to allow transparent
  usage of internal/external CLHEP via targets and without needing to use
  include_directories explicitly. Only set include paths in BUILD
  interface for consistency with other targets.

04 November 2016 - G.Cosmo
- Updated to CLHEP-2.3.4.3.
- Fixed array initialisation in Evaluator static method function().

08 July 2016 - G.Cosmo
- Corrected value of SPECIALMUL in mixmax.h to correspond to exact formula
  for N=17 (m=2^36+1).

10 May 2016 - G.Cosmo
- Updated to CLHEP-2.3.3.0.
- Corrected check for counter range in MixMaxRng::getState().
  Avoid hard-coded constant for initialisation of VECTOR_STATE_SIZE in
  MixMaxRng, to directly use actual value of "N" from mixmax.

02 May 2016 - G.Cosmo
- Added symbols 'us' and 'ps' for microsend and picosecond respectively
  to SystemOfUnits.h and setSystemOfUnits.cc and converted all symbols and
  constants from "static const" to "static constexpr".

28 April 2016 - G.Cosmo
- Restored skipping of sequences for safer setting of seeds in setSeeds()
  in MixMaxRng. Changed number of N in mixmax to 17 (was 256) and provided
  new skipping coefficients for the new value of N and for the case N=8.

25 April 2016 - G.Cosmo
- Use seed_spbox() for seeding MixMax with single seed.

21 April 2016 - G.Cosmo
- Refined fix for sequence skipping; make it optional by adding Boolean flag
  argument (true by default) in seed_uniquestream() function in mixmax.cc to
  force sequence skipping when setting seeds. Simplified code, removing
  compilation guard flags.
  Set flag to false by default in MixMaxRng wrapper and defined function
  skipSequencesOnce() to optional instruct to apply skipping of sequences
  at the next seeds setting.

20 April 2016 - G.Cosmo
- Updated to CLHEP-2.3.2.2:
  * Utility (L.Garren <garren@fnal.gov>)
    o Added use_atomic.h: use std::atomic when the compiler declares it 
      uses the C++11 standard.
  * Random (W.D.Dagenhart <wdd@fnal.gov>)
    o MixMaxRng.cc: the uncorrected code might not always yield independent
      seeds.
      If two threads execute numberOfEngines++ and after both finish that both
      execute setSeed, then they will have the same seed. Fixed.
    o Random.cc: there is a thread local variable of the type "defaults"
      that contains two shared_ptr's in Random.cc.  This causes an intermittent
      problem on OSX.  The complex objects containing the shared_ptr's have been
      moved into a list of objects and the now the thread_local only contains a
      simple pointer now that points into the list.
      Use the new Utility/use_atomic.h header.

19 April 2016 - G.Cosmo
- Commented out sequence skipping from built-in table in mixmax.cc (undefined
  flag SKIPISON), in order to avoid contention in multi-threaded jobs and
  simplify seeding procedure. Removed use of obselete 'register' keyword.
- Minor code cleanup in MixMaxRng.

11 April 2016 - G.Cosmo
- Use simple loop for flatArray() in MixMaxRng; engine built-in function
  turns out to be extremely slot and unefficient.

09 November 2015 - G.Cosmo
- Updated to CLHEP-2.3.1.1.
- Added MixMaxRng to Randomize.h.

30 October 2015 - G.Cosmo
- Fixed default seeding in MixMaxRng::setSeeds().

28 September 2015 - G.Cosmo
- Fixed compilation warning on gcc in mixmax.h for signed/unsigned comparison.
- Added reference to MixMaxRng.h.

25 September 2015 - G.Cosmo
- Added MixMaxRng to EngineFactory.
- Added copy-constructor and assignment operator to MixMaxRng.
- Replaced "#define N 256" with "static const unsigned int N = 256;"
  in mixmax[.h.cc] and adapted code accordingly; commented out unused
  cases for different values of N.
  Fixes symbols clashes within CLHEP namespace.

18 September 2015 - G.Cosmo
- Disable thread_local and atomic c++11 features specific for Intel-icc
  compiler in Utility module: thread_local.h, atomic_int.h.
  Use settings related to gcc.

15 September 2015 - G.Cosmo
- Fixes by K.Savvidy to allow for porting on Intel-icc compiler and
  Windows Visual Studio. Updated files: minmax[h.cc].

14 September 2015 - G.Cosmo

  Updated files: minmax[h.cc], mixmax_skip_N256.icc.

25 August 2015 - G.Cosmo
- Added MixMax random engine classes implementing the "Matrix Generator of
  Pseudorandom Numbers", as described in J. Compt. Phy. 97, 573 (1991).
  Added files:
  o MixMaxRng[h.cc]: CLHEP interface class to MixMax generator.
  o minmax[h.cc]: C++ translation/adaptation of the MixMax generator.
  o mixmax_skip_N256.icc: table of skipping coefficients for MixMax (N=256).

19 August 2015 - M.Maire
- Added liter and its sub units to SystemOfUnits.h: liter, L, dL, cL, mL.

12 August 2015 - G.Cosmo
- Use std::shared_ptr in random classes instead of internal Boost-derived
  implementation.
- Corrected RandExpZiggurat to use shared_ptr as for all other distributions.
- Utility module: removed Boost derived implementation of shared_ptr and
  weak_ptr, now typedefs to c++0x standard std::shared_ptr and std::weak_ptr
  respectively. Removed no longer used type_traits.h header.

7 August 2015 - G.Cosmo
- Temporarly commented out assertion in memory.h, in view of full transition
  to C++11 for use of shared_ptr et al..

6 August 2015 - G.Cosmo

    o memory.h: fixed a type mismatch (compilation warning on Windows/VC9).
  * Random (L.Garren <garren@fnal.gov>)
    o RanshiEngine.cc: use a pragma to ignore aggressive 32bit compiler
      warnings.
  * Vector (L.Garren <garren@fnal.gov>)
    o ThreeVector.icc: inline Hep3Vector::operator () (int i), following
      patch included in Geant4 on November 12th below.

14 November 2014 - G.Cosmo
- Updated to CLHEP-2.2.0.3:
  * Units (L.Garren <garren@fnal.gov>)

20 September 2011 - G.Cosmo
- Added missing export statements for static symbols required for DLL build.

22 June 2011 - B.Morgan
- CMakeLists.txt : Added the CLHEP include directory to
  GEANT4_BUILDTREE_INCLUDE_DIRS so that its visible from the build tree if
  we use the internal CLHEP.

20 June 2011 - B.Morgan
- CMakeLists.txt : Install CLHEP headers to
  CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR/PROJECT_NAME in line with new standard install
  directory structure.

14 June 2011 - B.Morgan
- CMakeLists.txt : Build G4clhep through standard GEANT4_LIBRARY_TARGET
  macro. Keep installation of headers as is.

13 June 2011 - B.Morgan
- CMakeLists.txt : Added use of new CMAKE_INSTALL_XXX variables to control
  installation of libraries and headers, and add exported libraries to a
  global property as per other Geant4 targets. Header paths are not added to
  a global property though because these can be internal or external, so
  we handle them higher up when generating the configuration files.

2 June 2011 - B.Morgan
- CMakeLists.txt : NEW file adding CMake build of 'G4clhep'
  Implemented as a single CMakeLists.txt because special handling of
  the nested header structure of CLHEP is needed at install time.

1 June 2011 - G.Cosmo
- Fixed trivial compilation warnings on gcc-4.6.0 in NonRandomEngine.h
  and Ranlux64Engine.cc for parameters defined but not used.

24 May 2011 - G.Cosmo
- Added missing files in CLHEP built-in module.
  Allow for generation of DLL library on Windows for it.

11 May 2011 - G.Cosmo
- Including a subset of CLHEP classes imported from version CLHEP-2.1.0.1.
- Modifications applied vs. original CLHEP classes:
  * Removed dependency on internal CLHEP "defs.h" configuration header;
    the Geant4 built-in module for CLHEP follows the Geant4 build scheme.
  * Adopt "std" namespace for standard mathematical functions, where needed.
  * Removed dependency on ZM exceptions and replaced with "cerr" printouts
    where necessary.
  * Renamed following files for coherency and standard:
    o Inlined code *.src to *.icc and moved to includes set;
    o DualConv.hh to DualConv.h.
  * Use coherent inclusion scheme also for internal headers/data/inline-code,
    where applicable.
  * Use of standard WIN32 compiler flag where applicable.
  * Cleared source code of de-activated debug blocks and minor cleanup,
    where applicable.
  * Rename of final CLHEP library produced, from 'CLHEP' to 'g4clhep'.
