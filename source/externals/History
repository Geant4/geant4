- Updated to CLHEP-2.3.4.4.
- CLHEP: fix in HepRotation::axis() for proper treatment of degenerating cases.
  Fixed compilation warnings on gcc-7.1 in Evaluator.cc.

28-February-2017 - G.Cosmo (externals-V10-03-00)
- Adapted CMake scripts to new configuration for internal/external
  packages of CLHEP, expat and zlib.

04-November-2016 - G.Cosmo (externals-V10-02-11)
- Updated to CLHEP-2.3.4.3.
- CLHEP: fixed array initialisation in Evaluator static method function().

08-July-2016 - G.Cosmo (externals-V10-02-10)
- CLHEP: corrected value of SPECIALMUL in mixmax.h to correspond to exact
  formula for N=17 (m=2^36+1).

10-May-2016 - G.Cosmo (externals-V10-02-09)
- Updated to CLHEP-2.3.3.0.
- CLHEP: corrected check for counter range in MixMaxRng::getState().
  Avoid hard-coded constant for initialisation of VECTOR_STATE_SIZE in
  MixMaxRng, to directly use actual value of "N" from mixmax.

02-May-2016 - G.Cosmo (externals-V10-02-08)
- CLHEP: added symbols 'us' and 'ps' for microsend and picosecond respectively
  to SystemOfUnits.h and setSystemOfUnits.cc and converted all symbols and
  constants from "static const" to "static constexpr".

28-April-2016 - G.Cosmo (externals-V10-02-07)
- CLHEP: restored skipping of sequences for safer seeds setting in setSeeds()
  in MixMaxRng. Changed number of N in mixmax to 17 (was 256) and provided
  new skipping coefficients for the new value of N and for the case N=8.

25-April-2016 - G.Cosmo (externals-V10-02-06)
- CLHEP: use seed_spbox() for seeding MixMax with single seed.

21-April-2016 - G.Cosmo (externals-V10-02-05, 04)
- CLHEP: refined fix for sequence skipping; make it optional by adding Boolean
  flag argument (true by default) in seed_uniquestream() function in mixmax.cc
  to force sequence skipping when setting seeds. Simplified code, removing
  compilation guard flags.
  Set flag to false by default in MixMaxRng wrapper and defined function
  skipSequencesOnce() to optional instruct to apply skipping of sequences
  at the next seeds setting.

20-April-2016: G.Cosmo (externals-V10-02-03, 02)
- Updated to CLHEP-2.3.2.2:
  o Added use_atomic.h header to use std::atomic if compiler supports it.
  o MixMaxRng: corrected initialisation and use of 'numberOfEngines'
    when more than one threads calls the constructor.
  o HepRandom: revised settings of "defaults" to use a single thread_local
    pointer.
- Including tag "zlib-V10-02-01":
  o Fix in gzguts.h for Windows with Visual Studio 2015 in 64 bit compilation.

19-April-2016: G.Cosmo (externals-V10-02-01)
- CLHEP: commented out seeds skipping from built-in table in mixmax.cc
  (undefined flag SKIPISON), in order to avoid contention in multi-threaded
  jobs and simplify seeding procedure. Removed use of obselete 'register'
  keyword. Minor code cleanup in MixMaxRng.

11-April-2016: G.Cosmo (externals-V10-02-00)
- CLHEP: use simple loop for flatArray() in MixMaxRng; engine built-in
  function turns out to be extremely slow and unefficient.

- Updated to CLHEP-2.3.1.1.
- Added MixMaxRng to Randomize.h.

30-October-2015 - G.Cosmo (externals-V10-01-18)

  external installation.

  compiler in Utility module: thread_local.h, atomic_int.h.
  Use settings related to gcc.

15-September-2015 - G.Cosmo (externals-V10-01-13)
- CLHEP: added MixMax random engine classes implementing the "Matrix Generator
  of Pseudorandom Numbers", as described in J. Compt. Phy. 97, 573 (1991).
  Added files:
  o MixMaxRng[h.cc]: CLHEP interface class to MixMax generator.
  o minmax[h.cc]: C++ translation/adaptation of the MixMax generator.
  o mixmax_skip_N256.icc: table of skipping coefficients for MixMax (N=256).
