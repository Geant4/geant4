# History entries prior to 11.0

20-October-2020: Ben Morgan (expat-V10-06-00)
- Migrate build of G4expat to locally defined targets, allowing
  cleaner specification of usage requirements. Fixes GitLab Issue #44.

03-February-2017: Ben Morgan expat-V10-03-00
- Set interface include directories on G4expat{-static} targets
  in CMakeLists.txt. This provides the needed interface to allow transparent
  usage of internal/external expat via targets and without needing to use
  include_directories explicitly. Only set include paths in BUILD
  interface for consistency with other targets.

24-September-2015: Ben Morgan  expat-V10-01-01
- CMakeLists.txt : Add XML_STATIC to public compile definitions
  of G4expat-static. Required on Windows platforms to ensure correct
  linkage of symbols in static mode.

28-July-2015: Ben Morgan    expat-V10-01-00
- Upgrade source code to expat 2.1.0
- expat_config.h.cmake : templated config file from expat sources. Used
  in CMake build, old pre-configured version fron GNUmake retained in
  src/ folder.
- sources.cmake : import configuration from expat 2.1.0 CMakeLists.txt,
  always taking defaults.
- xmlparse.cc, xmltok.cc, xmlrole.cc : Use pragmas to suppress trivial
  warnings for GNU and Clang compilers. No warnings emitted on Windows.
  Intel compiler may require further testing.

07-November-2011: Gabriele Cosmo
- Fixed trivial compilation warning on Mac in xmlparse.cc.

02-June-2011: Ben Morgan
- sources.cmake  : NEW file adding G4expat module definition, with build and
  installation as a standard Geant4 module. All headers are therefore installed
  'flat' into the same directory as the Geant4 headers.
- CMakeLists.txt : NEW file adding CMake build support for expat.

12-May-2011: Gunter Folger			expat-V09-04-00
- Keep only Geant4 relevant parts of expat, lay out adapted to Geant4:
  GNUmakefile, and src & include



April-2011: Gunter Folger			expat-2.0.1
- Files of orginal expat 2.0.1 release, no G4 mods.
