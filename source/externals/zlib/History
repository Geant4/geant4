History file for G4 zlib package
--------------------------------

21 June 2018 Gunter Folger  (zlib-V10-04-03)
-  gzwrite.c: one more cast to int, 

20 June 2018 Gunter Folger  (zlib-V10-04-02)
- fixes in gzread.c/gzwrite.c for Windows 64 bit builds. 
    Correctioins taken from https://github.com/madler/zlib/pull/279

14 June 2018 Gunter Folger  (zlib-V10-04-01)
-  move all includes in src/ to include/; This helps keep 
     geant4_validate_sources.cmake simpler  
     
12 June 2018 Gunter Folger  (zlib-V10-04-00)
- addressing compilation warnings from gcc8:
   switch back to original source from zlib 1.2.11, and use C compiler.
   
18 May 2017 Gunter Folger   (zlib-V10-03-01)
- disable warning on fall-through on many case statements issued by gcc7
   add directive -Wno-implicit-fallthrough in CMakeLists.txt, and fix copy-paste typo.

03 February 2017 Ben Morgan (zlib-V10-03-00)
- Set interface include directories on G4zlib{-static} targets
  in CMakeLists.txt. This provides the needed interface to allow transparent
  usage of internal/external zlib via targets and without needing to use
  include_directories explicitly. Only set include paths in BUILD
  interface for consistency with other targets.

19 April 2015 Gunter Folger   (zlib-V10-02-01)
-  fix in gzguts.h for Windows; as of Studio 2015 in 64 bit compilation,
    _snprintf is no longer provided, but snprintf finally is available. 

15 January 2015Gunter Folger   (zlib-V10-02-00)
-  fix clang compiler warning in inflate.cc: return explicit value 
     of -1L << 16 (0xffffFFFFffff000L)
	  
10 July 2015 Gunter Folger  (zlib-V10-01-01)
-  Add type casts to fix windows compilations errors.

8 July 2015 Gunter Folger   (zlib-V10-01-00)
-  Update to zlib-1.2.8, keeping out structure. 
    Compare files to new zlib, and transfer changes, keeping local
	 modifications, like function declarationss, and removed register keyword.
	 Note that test06 now contains the test code.
	  
10 April 2014 Gabriele Cosmo (zlib-V10-00-01)
-  Get rid of deprecated 'register' storage class specifier in source files
   crc32.cc, deflate.cc and trees.cc.

18 March 2014 Gabriele Cosmo (zlib-V10-00-00)
-  Fixed compilation warnings from clang-3.4 for unused variables in
   deflate.cc and inftrees.cc 

7 May 2013 Gunter Folger     (zlib-V09-06-03)
-  Fixes for Windows:
   - Add few more explicit typecasts, in #ifdef protected code
   - in inflate.h,.cc an enum used OS, this clashes with a #define, rename OS to
     OS_ZLIB
   - sources.cmake: add -DZLIB_DLL, to export symbols, don't rename debug
     version of G4zlib to G4zlibd.

6 May 2013 Gunter Folger     (zlib-V09-06-02)
-  Adapt full zlib to G4 cmake:
   - copied portions of zlib CMakeLists.tzt to sources.cmake, 
     using standard G4 CMakeLists.txt     
   - Private header are in src, include only has zlib.h. zconf.h is created 
     in build tree from src/zconf.h.cmakein; zlib.h and zconf.h are installed.   

27 March 2013 Gunter Folger  (zlib-V09-06-01)
-  Update to zlib  1.2.7
   - include complete zlib, not only writer.
   
20 March 2013 Gabriele Cosmo (zlib-V09-06-00)
-  Moved from visualization/externals module

25 May 2005 Mark Donszelmann
-  zlib version 1.2.2
