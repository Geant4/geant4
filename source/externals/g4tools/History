- Fixed compilation warnings for implicit type conversions on macOS/XCode 14.1
  in files: spline, THistogram and zlib.

## 2022-10-13 Guy Barrand (g4tools-V11-00-12)
- tools/fpng, fpng.icc: a pure header, thread safe, png writer.
- tools/toojpeg, toojpeg.icc: a pure header, thread safe, jpeg writer.
- tools/offscreen/session, sg_viewer: to handle offscreen graphics.
- tools/sg/gl2ps_action: revisit lightening logic to be closer than the OpenGL one.

- toolx/sg/GL_action: handle ambient color lightening.
- tools/sg/write_paper: gl2ps, zb formats: handle transparency.
- tools/gl2ps: handle the TOOLS_GL2PS_PORTABLE_SORT to be able to produce same output
  file on all platforms. (Related to the fact that qsort, for "same objects", may not
  produce the same "equal" sub lists on all platforms).

## 2022-10-10 Guy Barrand (g4tools-V11-00-11)
- intel-icx: fix compilation warnings for the variable "size"

- tools/typedefs, rroot/file, wroot/file and toolx/Windows/glarea, Qt/session, mpi/wrmpi:
  some #ifdef for MinGW. The ones in wroot/file are important to produce good .root files.
- tools/gl2ps: replace the usage of sprintf, by strcpy or std::ostringstream.

## 2022-10-04 Gabriele Cosmo (g4tools-V11-00-09)
- Fixed compilation warnings on Intel-icx compiler for variables
  set but not used in plotter::rep_bins2D_xy_random_one() and

## 2022-05-03 Guy Barrand (g4tools-V11-00-05)
- tools/version: pass to 5.7.1.

## 2022-03-11 Guy Barrand (g4tools-V11-00-03)
- tools/version: pass to 5.6.3.
- in a lot of files (see History_tools for a list): for intel compiler: quiet "hides variable" warnings; mainly by renaming "s" to "_s" to avoid a clash with CLHEP::s.

## 2022-02-11 Guy Barrand (g4tools-V11-00-02)
- tools/version: pass to 5.6.2.
- tools/gl2ps: in tools_gl2psFindRoot(), have a '*root = 0" initialisation before the first in "if()" return.
