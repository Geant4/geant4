                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the log-message one should put at every
committal in the code repository !

22 Jan 2021 - B.Morgan (ptl-V10-06-10)
- Apply patch from Gunter to fix component installs on Windows

8 Nov 2020 - B.Morgan (ptl-V10-06-09)
- Force installation of PTL headers to CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR/Geant4, following
  behaviour for other builtins
- Don't override CMAKE_INSTALL_CONFIGDIR variable as this should be set in the parent
  directory.

2 Nov 2020 - B.Morgan (ptl-V10-06-08)
- BUGFIX #2286: Install PTL DLL/archive into appropriate platform dependent
  locations.

20 Oct 2020 - B.Morgan (ptl-V10-06-07)
- Export interface targets used by both static and shared variants of
  PTL to a dedicated file in the build directory. Required to avoid
  missing/double definitions of targets when building Geant4/PTL with
  shared/static at the same time.

5 Oct 2020 - J.Madsen(ptl-V10-06-06)
- Stability fixes for ensuring that stack variables are copied
  into task-group functions

23 Sept 2020 - J.Madsen (ptl-V10-06-05)
- All template parameters using leading underscore followed by
  capital letter have been replaced --> reserved for standard library
- TaskGroup and TBBTaskGroup support non-aggregating join function
- Arguments are copied into tuple for tasks

12 Sept 2020 - J.Madsen (ptl-V10-06-04)
- Fixed issues with PTL::ThreadPool destruction.
  - For some ill-advised reason, the original impl detached the threads
    instead of joining them to ensure they were deleted
- Created generic execute_on_all_threads member function for thread pool
  - this handles the complexity of performing this operation w/ TBB
- cleaned up the inconsistent naming in PTL::ThreadPool

23 June 2020 - J.Madsen (ptl-V10-06-03)
- Tweaked VTaskGroup to use a vector instead of list
- Declared the default ctor/dtor/assign-op for
  JoinFunction class in TaskGroup

22 June 2020 - B.Morgan (ptl-V10-06-02)
- Force use of -pthread on non-Win32 platforms

18 June 2020 - G.Cosmo (ptl-V10-06-01)
- Adapted files organisation to Geant4 and fixed porting on Windows DLLs.
- Changed library name to "G4ptl", to distinguish from external installation.
- Integrated with GNUmake system.

8 May 2020 - J.Madsen (ptl-V10-06-00)
- New module for built-in Parallel Tasking Library (PTL), a Lightweight
  C++11 multithreading tasking system featuring thread-pool, task-groups,
  and lock-free task queue.
  Original version 0.0.2.
