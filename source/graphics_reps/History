    .  SetForceCloud
    .  SetForceNumberOfCloudPoints

24 February 2019  John Allison (greps-V10-05-02)
- Remove Get/SetDrawOverlapsFlag from G4VVisManager.

19 February 2019  John Allison
- Included in vis-V10-05-12
- G4VisExtent:
  o Replaced operator*(const G4Transform3D&) by
    Transform(const G4Transform3D&).
    (Note: operator* was only ever in a development version of Geant4.)

31 January 2019  Ivana Hrivnacova (greps-V10-05-01)
- Merged GitHub PR #4: all Boolean operators now return G4bool.

02 January 2018  John Allison (greps-V10-05-00)
- G4VisExtent: Add operator*(const G4Transform3D&).

19 October 2018  John Allison (greps-V10-04-08)
- G4VisExtent: Add GetNullExtent.

16 October 2018  John Allison (greps-V10-04-07)

- G4VVisManager: Add fDrawOverlapsFlag and access functions.
  o This is intended to be inspected by methods capable of drawing
    overlaps. See for example, CheckOverlaps in G4PVPlacement and
    G4PVParameterised.

22 May 2018  Gabriele Cosmo (greps-V10-04-05)
- Disabled deprecated static data member G4VisAttributes::Invisible for
  Windows systems.

24 April 2018  John Allison (greps-V10-04-04)
- Co-works vis-V10-04-04.
- G4VisAttributes: Cosmetic improvements.

23 April 2018  John Allison (greps-V10-04-03)
- Co-works vis-V10-04-04.
- Replaced DBL_MAX by G4VisAttributes::veryLargeTime = 1.e100*CLHEP::ns,
  about 1.e75 billion years!! The problem is that DBL_MAX (1.79769e+308)
  is dimensionless, so we compromise with something a little less vast,
  but which is in G4 internal units.

18th January 2018  Gabriele Cosmo (greps-V10-04-01)
- Updated GNUmakefile to add G4GREPS_ALLOC_EXPORT definition.

18th January 2018  Ben Morgan (greps-V10-04-00)
- Fix unexported global data for WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS
- New DLL build method identified that G4VisAttributes has a 
  static const member that is not declared dllexport/import.
- graphics_reps_defs.hh: New header to configure the needed
  export/import keywords, using a macro G4GREPS_DLL
- CMakeLists.txt: Add -D flag G4GREPS_ALLOC_EXPORT when
  building the library to make export mode.
- G4VisAttributes.hh: Mark static const G4VisAttributes data
  using G4GREPS_DLL to ensure export/import.

6th October 2017  John Allison  (greps-V10-03-07)
- Rationalised:
  o Colour map no longer G4ThreadLocal (no need). May be used from
    non-master threads.
  o Move InitialiseColourMap from private to public. In future vis tags
    the map will be initialised from the vis manager.

13th September 2017  John Allison  (greps-V10-03-06)
- HepPolyhedron.h: Reverted default number of line segments per circle:
  #define DEFAULT_NUMBER_OF_STEPS 24
  (72 lines per circle gives trouble in the Boolean Processor, so until that
  is fixed we revert to 24.)

1st August 2017  John Allison  (greps-V10-03-05)
- G4AttDefStore: Shared (i.e., no longer thread local). Added mutex.

10th May 2017  John Allison  (greps-V10-03-04)
- G4Colour: Added Set functions for components.

25th April 2017  John Allison  (greps-V10-03-03)
- G4Colour& operator += (const G4Colour& rhs) {*this = rhs; return *this;}
  // Note: This is required by RayTracer in its use of G4THitsMap.
  // Adding colours, without also taking brightness into account, does not make
  // sense, so let us make it synonymous with operator=, which is, I guess,
  // equivalent to covering the old colour with the new, like a coat of paint.

22nd February 2017  John Allison  (greps-V10-03-01)
- Requires visman-V10-03-03.
- Removed G4VisExtent::NullExtent.

6th September 2016  Makoto Asai (greps-V10-02-07)
- Co-works with digits_hits-V10-02-06, vis-V10-02-12
- include/G4VGraphicsScene.hh
     It accepts both G4TMitsMap<G4StatDouble> and G4THitsMap<G4double>.
  
2nd September 2016  Makoto Asai (greps-V10-02-06)
- Co-works with digits_hits-V10-02-05, vis-V10-02-10

     Build-in scorer now uses G4TMitsMap<G4StatDouble> instead of
     G4THitsMap<G4double>.
  
31st August 2016  John Allison  (greps-V10-02-05)
- Co-works vis-V10-02-09.
- G4VGraphicsScene.hh:
  o Added
    virtual void AddSolid (const G4Orb&) = 0;
    virtual void AddSolid (const G4Ellipsoid&) = 0;
  o Tidied.

7th August 2016  John Allison  (greps-V10-02-03)
- G4VisAttributes.icc: Removed extraneous semi-colon.

7th August 2016  John Allison  (greps-V10-02-02)
- G4VisAttributes:
  o Added flag for force auxiliary edge visibility, i.e., to record
    if the user has asked for forcing, while the value forced - visible
    or invisible - is recorded in another flag.
  o Introduced default argument - "true" - for:
    SetVisibility, SetDaughtersInvisible, SetForceWireframe,
    SetForceSolid, SetForceAuxEdgeVisible.
  o Improved logic for setting force drawing style and auxiliary edge
    visibility.
  o Moved above methods from .icc to .cc.
  o Moved static inline method GetMinLineSegmentsPerCircle to .icc.

14th July 2016  John Allison  (greps-V10-02-01)
- G4VisAttributes::GetInvisible():
  o Changed to use a static instance instead of G4VisAttributes::Invisible.
  o Moved implementation to .cc file.  Now it is non-inline.
- G4VisAttributes::Invisible:
  o Deprecated. It is a static instance and does not always instantiate
    properly on Windows.

6th March 2015  John Allison  (greps-V10-01-02)
- HepPolyhedron: Corrected a long-standing spelling mistake:
  o indeces should be indices;
  o verteces should be vertices.
  This is reflected in the method names, but the old names have been
  kept for backwards compatibility.

14th August 2014  John Allison  (greps-V10-01-01)
- G4VisAttributes.cc: Eliminated a nonsensical “if(&a)” in operator<<.

- Fix compilation error for sequential mode.

19th September 2013  Makoto Asai (greps-V09-06-10)
- Introducing G4VVisManager::IgnoreStateChanges() virtual method.
  This method should be invoked by a class that has its own event loop,
  such as the RayTracer, material scanner, etc. If the argument is true,
  the following state changes among Idle, GeomClosed and EventProc are
  caused by such a class, and thus not by the ordinary event simulation.
  The same method with false should be invoked once such an event loop
  is over.

17th September 2013  Makoto Asai (greps-V09-06-09)
- G4Colour now has a dummy += operator.

12th September 2013  Makoto Asai (greps-V09-06-08)
- Introducing G4VVisManager::SetUpForAThread(). This method is invoked
  by G4WorkerRunManager so that G4VisManager will get noticed at the
  end of event of each worker thread.

12th September 2013  Makoto Asai (greps-V09-06-07)
- Remove G4ThreadLocal keyword from G4VVisManager.

  G4TypeKey, G4TypeKeyT, G4Colour, HepPolyhedron and BooleanProcessor.

6th March 2013  John Allison (greps-V09-06-04)
- HepPolyhedron.cc:
  o Introduced const G4double spatialTolerance = 0.01*nm;
  o Used in RotateAroundZ and in HepPolyhedronSphere and HepPolyhedronTorus
    constructors.
  o Allows creation of nm-sized objects.
  o Fixes bug report 1452.

14th February 2013 Jean Jacquemier

- G4DimensionedType.hh:
  o Reverted to r53697.
  o The last 3 tags cure the clang warning but cause run-time problems with
    x86_64-slc5-gcc43-staticlibs

25th September 2012  John Allison (greps-V09-05-12)
- G4DimensionedType.hh: using namespace G4DimensionedTypeNameSpace, but changed
  the name of the function to GetTheUnitValue (there is another GetUnitValue elsewhere).

19th September 2012  John Allison (greps-V09-05-11)
- G4DimensionedType.hh: Specifically defined G4DimensionedTypeNameSpace::GetUnitValue,
  which keeps clang happy.  Hopefully other compilers too.

15th August 2012  John Allison (greps-V09-05-10)
- G4DimensionedType.hh: Introduced G4DimensionedTypeNameSpace to replace an
  un-name namespace to keep the clang compiler happy and improve the lives
  of system testers.

    distinguish usage and in preparation for i_mode migration.

7th May 2010  John Allison  (greps-V09-03-00)
- G4VVisManager: Added a public static boolean flag,
  IsDefaultDrawTrajectory, to assist deprecation of i-mode trajectory
  drawing parameter.  After 10.0, it can be removed.
