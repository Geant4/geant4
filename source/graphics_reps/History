10th May 2017  John Allison  (greps-V10-03-04)
- G4Colour: Added Set functions for components.

25th April 2017  John Allison  (greps-V10-03-03)
- G4Colour& operator += (const G4Colour& rhs) {*this = rhs; return *this;}
  // Note: This is required by RayTracer in its use of G4THitsMap.
  // Adding colours, without also taking brightness into account, does not make
  // sense, so let us make it synonymous with operator=, which is, I guess,
  // equivalent to covering the old colour with the new, like a coat of paint.

22nd February 2017  John Allison  (greps-V10-03-01)
- Requires visman-V10-03-03.
- Removed G4VisExtent::NullExtent.

31st August 2016  John Allison  (greps-V10-02-05)
- Co-works vis-V10-02-09.
- G4VGraphicsScene.hh:

- G4VisAttributes::GetInvisible():
  o Changed to use a static instance instead of G4VisAttributes::Invisible.
  o Moved implementation to .cc file.  Now it is non-inline.
- G4VisAttributes::Invisible:
  o Deprecated. It is a static instance and does not always instantiate

  HepPolyhedronProcessor.h.

- HepPolyhedron: Minor fix for Coverity.

6th March 2015  John Allison  (greps-V10-01-02)
- HepPolyhedron: Corrected a long-standing spelling mistake:
  o indeces should be indices;
  o verteces should be vertices.
  This is reflected in the method names, but the old names have been
  kept for backwards compatibility.

- Fix compilation error for sequential mode.

19th September 2013  Makoto Asai (greps-V09-06-10)
- Introducing G4VVisManager::IgnoreStateChanges() virtual method.
  This method should be invoked by a class that has its own event loop,
  such as the RayTracer, material scanner, etc. If the argument is true,
  the following state changes among Idle, GeomClosed and EventProc are
  caused by such a class, and thus not by the ordinary event simulation.
  The same method with false should be invoked once such an event loop
  is over.

17th September 2013  Makoto Asai (greps-V09-06-09)
- G4Colour now has a dummy += operator.

12th September 2013  Makoto Asai (greps-V09-06-08)
- Introducing G4VVisManager::SetUpForAThread(). This method is invoked
  by G4WorkerRunManager so that G4VisManager will get noticed at the
  end of event of each worker thread.

12th September 2013  Makoto Asai (greps-V09-06-07)
- Remove G4ThreadLocal keyword from G4VVisManager.

    constructors.

  ( see  TAG greps-V09-06-02 ). These modifications will be done once 
  MultiThreading performance loss will be recover

- G4DimensionedType.hh:
  o Reverted to r53697.
  o The last 3 tags cure the clang warning but cause run-time problems with
    x86_64-slc5-gcc43-staticlibs

25th September 2012  John Allison (greps-V09-05-12)
- G4DimensionedType.hh: using namespace G4DimensionedTypeNameSpace, but changed
  the name of the function to GetTheUnitValue (there is another GetUnitValue elsewhere).

19th September 2012  John Allison (greps-V09-05-11)
- G4DimensionedType.hh: Specifically defined G4DimensionedTypeNameSpace::GetUnitValue,
  which keeps clang happy.  Hopefully other compilers too.

15th August 2012  John Allison (greps-V09-05-10)
- G4DimensionedType.hh: Introduced G4DimensionedTypeNameSpace to replace an
  un-name namespace to keep the clang compiler happy and improve the lives
  of system testers.

- Added G4Text::G4Text(const G4Text& text) (copy contructor).
- Added G4Text& operator=(const G4Text& text) (assignment operator).

1st February 2012  John Allison  (greps-V09-05-03)

  o Implemented GetMap.

29th September 2011  John Allison  (greps-V09-04-08)

- BooleanProcessor.cc:
  o Changed cout to G4cout, etc.
  o Fixed Coverity warnings.

24th March 2011  Gabriele Cosmo  (greps-V09-04-02)
- Consistently make use of G4 types in HepPolyhedron and BooleanProcessor,
  to allow for centralized control of CLHEP classes.

    distinguish usage and in preparation for i_mode migration.

7th May 2010  John Allison  (greps-V09-03-00)
- G4VVisManager: Added a public static boolean flag,
  IsDefaultDrawTrajectory, to assist deprecation of i-mode trajectory

- BooleanProcessor.src : modifs coming from LHCb to "loop on shifts"
  to attempt solving the "coplanar faces cases".

  to allow for porting on Intel-icc compiler.

3rd April 2007  John Allison  (greps-V08-02-01)
- G4AttDefStore: now comprises utility functions in namespace
  G4AttDefStore.  (Used to be a class with only static functions and

  proper usage.

5th January 2007  John Allison  (greps-V08-02-00)

  o SetForceLineSegmentsPerCircle: Bug fix: Now correctly implements reset.
  o Minor refinement: Introduced IsForceLineSegmentsPerCircle().
- G4Colour: Replaced static data members by static functions that
  create and copy out the relevant colours.  (Static data members make
  a lot of noise in the gdb debugger.  Anyway, are best avoided.)

7th November 2006  John Allison  (greps-V08-01-11)
- HepPolyhedronEllipticalCone: Bug fix.

24th October 2006  John Allison  (greps-V08-01-08; co-works: vis-V08-01-08)
- G4VisAttributes: Change GetAttValues to CreateAttValues.  It creates
  an expendable copy on the heap, thus following the behaviour of
  CreateAttValues in trajectories, hits, etc.  This achieves consistency
  of behaviour and user expectation; the user must delete after use.
- G4AttHolder: Remove CopyAndAddAttValues.  No longer needed after
  above change to G4VisAttributes.

- Added G4PolyhedronArbitrary:
  o Moved from geometry/solids/specific, where it was part of a
    development by Peter Truscott and Fan Lei of QinetiQ.
