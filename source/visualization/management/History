8th June 2006 John Allison  (visman-V08-00-23)
- Fixed bug in /vis/scene/endOfRunAction introduced in visman-V08-00-14
  that made it ineffective.

7th June 2006 John Allison  (visman-V08-00-22)
- G4VSceneHandler.cc: Zeroed modeling parameters pointer after use.

6th June 2006 John Allison  (visman-V08-00-21)
- G4VisCommandsViewer: /vis/viewer/create: Fixed view params copy to self.

4th June 2006 Joseph Perl (visman-V08-00-20)
- This tag includes all the changes below.

2nd June 2006 Jane Tinslay
- Add accessor for current trajectory drawing model
- Make G4HepRepFileSceneHandler a friend of G4VisManager

1st June 2006 Jane Tinslay
- Add accessor in G4VisListManager

30th May 2006 Jane Tinslay
- Add G4TrajectoryChargeFilterFactory and G4TrajectoryOriginVolumeFilterFactory
  to G4VisExecutive

25th May 2006 John Allison  (visman-V08-00-19)
- G4Scene.cc: Changed default fRecomputeTransients to false.
- G4VisCommandsViewerSet.cc: /vis/viewer/set/style - remove candidates.
  Use first letter only (so "/vis/viewer/set/style wire" works, for example.)
- G4VisFilter/List/ModelManager.hh: Indent printing of models.
- G4VUserVisAction.hh: Add forward declaration of class G4VGraphicsScene.

22nd May 2006 John Allison  (visman-V08-00-18)
- G4VisManager:
  o Added SetReprocessing (for transients).
  o Reduce dependency on Run (get event from event manager).
  o (Includes some event copying stuff - commented out.)
- G4VSceneHandler.cc: Require Idle state for transient re-computation.
- G4Scene:
  o Remove Clear().  (Not used.)
  o Add printing and testing for fRecomputeTransients.  (Forgot in
    visman-V08-00-08.)
- /vis/.../list commands: Default verbosity "warnings".

13th May 2006 John Allison  (visman-V08-00-17)
- Provided identity transformation for 2D drawing.  A temporary
  expedient until all drivers can implement 2D drawing.

12th May 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-16)
- Added /vis/list.
- Added /vis/scene/add/eventID.
- Final refinements for event/run reprocessing (re-computation of
  transients):
  o Pick up random number status from run manager.
  o Run and event numbers reset.
  o Protect against non-instantiation of run manager.
- Followed G4CallbackModel change (see modeling-V08-00-09).
- G4VisCommandsScene.cc, G4VisCommandsSceneHandler.cc, G4VisCommandsViewer.cc:
  Corrected SetDefaultValue for verbosity string parameter (changed 0 to "0").

4th May 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-15)
- Improved protection for null models and parameters.

2nd May 2006 Jane Tinslay 
- Add G4TrajectoryGenericDrawerFactory to G4VisExecutive

28th April 2006  John Allison (visman-V08-00-14)
- G4VSceneHandler.cc: Added call to FinishView after run-duration
  model computation and before end-of-event and transients
  re-computation to get good buffer swapping behaviour for double
  buffer drivers.
- G4VisCommandsScene.cc: Added protection in
  /vis/scene/endOfRunAction.  Error for accumulate if end of event
  action is not also accumulate.
- G4VisManager: To get good refresh bahaviour when re-computing
  transients in OpenGL*Xm and similar drivers, postpone ShowView to
  end of run for last event in a run.  This ensures G4 is in Idle
  state.
- GNUmakefile: Added includes for access to run manager for above.

22nd April 2006  John Allison (visman-V08-00-13)

- G4VisManager:
  o Implemented Draw2D(const G4Text&).
  o Added PrintAvailableModels (but awaiting implementation).
  o Fixed directory names (trailing '/').

  o Fixed recomputation of transients.

8th March 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-09)
- G4VisManager.cc: Fix bug that causes crash when no current scene handler.

6th March 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-08)
- Added /vis/scene/transientsAction, a feature for recomputing
  transients (trajectories, hits, user drawing, etc.) when needed by
  the viewer.  Thus, transients are "remembered" and may be copied
  between graphics systems.

9th February 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-07)
- First implementation of refresh end-of-event models (trajectories, etc.).

8th February 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-06)
- Needs modeling-V08-00-02.
- G4VSceneHandler.cc: Made use of G4ModelingParameters::DrawingStyle.
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Removed unnecessary #include.

3rd February 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-05)
- Introduced /vis/geometry/... for editing vis attributes of geometry volumes.
- Very minor printing and comments improvements.

26th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-04)
- G4VViewer: Removed fModified.  It was used to flag a change of view
  parameters but it was only ever used negatively, i.e., to *prevent*
  its effect of invoking SetView.  So it has been removed and the
  responsibility for calling SetView after a change of view parameters
  rests with the user (e.g., the vis commands).  Only used by OpenGL
  and OpenInventor; now works with opengl-V08-00-01 and
  openinventor-V08-00-00.
- G4VSceneHandler.hh: Improved comments.
- G4VisListManager.hh: Prevent crash on attempt to Print when nothing
  registered.
- G4VisManager.hh: Extended friendship to G4XXXSceneHandler.

25th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-03)
- Retro tag: visman-V08-00-00 + friend status for Ray Tracer.

11th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-02)
- G4VisExecutive.icc: protected with G4VISEXECUTIVE_ICC.
- G4VisManager.hh: prepared for RayTracer reorganisation (friend status).
- G4VisCommandsScene.cc: /vis/scene/create: simplified registration of
  scene to avoid recursive invocation of /vis/scene/notifyHandlers/.
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Improved message when world not available.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: /vis/viewer/refresh: When world added, delegate
  to /vis/scene/notifyHandlers.  Avoids double refresh.
- G4VisManager.cc: Changed ERROR to WARNING when user calls Draw with
  invalid view.

9th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-01)
- This tag includes all the changes below.

9th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-00)
- This tag is geant4-08-00-ref-00 + change of 5th January only.

5th January 2006  John Allison
- G4VSceneHandler.cc: Reversed change of 22nd November 2005:
  fMarkForClearingTransientStore(true) initially now.  This is so that
  at end of event or run, the view is refreshed and the scene
  (detector geometry, etc.) is drawn or written to file.

14th December 2005  John Allison
- Improved /vis/scene/notifyHandlers so that it forces a rebuild of the
  graphical database, if any.  Particularly relevant for Open Inventor.
- G4Scene.cc, G4VSceneHandler.cc: Improved warning messages.
- G4VisManager.cc: Apply "/vis/scene/notifyHandlers" if world has been added
  to an empty scene.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: "/vis/viewer/refresh": if world is added to
  an empty scene, invoke UpdateVisManagerScene, which applies
  "/vis/scene/notifyHandlers", which now forces a rebuild.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: Fix bug in "/vis/viewer/rebuild".

4th December  John Allison (visman-V07-01-10)
- G4Vismanager.cc: Prevent ERROR messages at end of event and run when
  user has not instantiated a scene handler, e.g., in batch mode.

29th November 2005  Jane Tinslay
- Make G4VisManager::RegisterModelFactories() non-pure for 
  backwards compatibility.
- Add information message to G4VisManager::DispatchToModel when default trajectory
  model is used.

23rd November 2005  Joseph Perl  (visman-V07-01-09)
- Tagged in preparation for Geant4 8.0

    G4int i_mode).
  o Created /vis/modeling/trajectories/ for trajectory model messengers.
  o Added XGeometryString for some future viewer enhancements.
- G4VisExecutive: Added RegisterTrajectoryModelMakers.

20th October 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-06)
- Get standard colours with "/vis/viewer/set/background red", for example.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: Fixed G4ThreeVector/G4Vector3D problem with
  CLHEP-1.9.2.1.

13th October 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-05)
- Background colour - /vis/viewer/set/background.
- Non-uniform scaling - /vis/viewer/scale and scaleTo.
- Migrated to <sstream>.

12th October 2005  John Allison (vis-V07-01-03)

  (bug found by system test of vis-V07-01-02).

16th September 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-04)
- Simplified use of ConcreteInstance.  It is now always non-zero for
  an instantiated vis manager; invalid views are reported by the vis
  manager.  The exception is /vis/disable which zeros it; /vis/enable
  or any valid command resets it.

16th September 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-03)
- Issue "/tracking/storeTrajectory 1" on /vis/scene/add/trajectories.
