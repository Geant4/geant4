    scene list.
  o Improve some message printing.
- G4VisCommandsSet.cc:
  o Improve guidance for /vis/set/volumeForField.
- G4VisCommandsViewerDefault.cc:
  o Improve code readability.
- G4VisCommandsViewerSet.cc:
  o Fix bug in /vis/viewer/set/style:
    . Bug was: could not return from cloud to wireframe or solid.
  o Improve code readability.

19 September 2019  Makoto Asai (visman-V10-05-12)
- G4VSceneHandler.cc
  o Namespace scope is added to MeshScoreMap
  o Co-working with detutils-V10-05-01

29 August 2019  John Allison (visman-V10-05-11)
- Part of vis-V10-05-24.
- Add G4TessellatedSolid to list of solids that may be specially treated

22 August 2019  John Allison (visman-V10-05-10)

      writes run and event no for each event.
- G4VisCommandsCompound.cc: /vis/drawTree:
  o Ensure vis is enabled (and restore ableness after). This is so that
    the command works even if vis is disabled.

17 August 2019  John Allison (visman-V10-05-09)
- G4VisManager.cc:
  o Clear graphics stores and viewer screen if scene contains no
    run duration models. E.g., after geometry has changed.

- Part of vis-V10-05-20.
- G4VSceneHandler:
  o Final changes for introduction of cloud drawing.
  o Add GetNumberOfCloudPoints:
    Returns no of cloud points from current view parameters, unless the user
    has forced through the vis attributes, thereby over-riding the
    current view parameter.
- G4ViewParameters:
  o Add accessors for number of cloud points.

- G4VisManager.cc:
  o Removed the word "WARNING" from message about number of events
    kept for refreshing and/or reviewing.

04 April 2019  John Allison (visman-V10-05-04)
- Co-works modeling-V10-05-01.
- Final (for now) corrections to /vis/viewer/set/sectionPlane.
  Still some strange behaviour in small fraction of cases. See
  comments in G4PhysicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid around line 748.

29 March 2019  John Allison (visman-V10-05-03)
- G4VSceneHandler.hh:
  o BeginPrimitives/2D: Added default argument G4Transform3D() to
    correspond to base class G4VGraphicsScene.
- G4ViewParameters.hh:
  o Improved comments.
- G4Scene.cc: Improved operator<<.

24 March 2019  John Allison (visman-V10-05-02)
- Fix bug in /vis/viewer/set/sectionPlane.
  Involves using G4DisplacedSolid instead of plain G4VSolid.

18 March 2019  Gabriele Cosmo (visman-V10-05-01)
- Corrected few typos in printout/comments.

10 March 2019  John Allison  (visman-V10-05-00)
- Introduce cloud drawing style:
  New parameter candidate in /vis/viewer/set/style:
    /vis/viewer/set/style cloud
  Cloud drawing uses solid->GetPointOnSurface, i.e., it uses kernel
  algorithms and by-passes polyhedral representations. The solid is
  represented by a polymarker of dots. The default number of points
  is 1000. This can be changed with
    /vis/viewer/set/numberOfCloudPoints
  (The minimum number is 100.)
  Note that OpenGL has a fast algorithm for polymarker.
- This allows us to use cloud style both as a choice or as fallback when the
  polyhedral representation fails, for example, when BooleanProcessor fails.
- Many files affected:
  o G4ViewParameters.hh/icc/cc
  enum DrawingStyle {
    wireframe,  // Draw edges    - no hidden line removal.
    hlr,        // Draw edges    - hidden lines removed.
    hsr,        // Draw surfaces - hidden surfaces removed.
    hlhsr,      // Draw surfaces and edges - hidden removed.
    cloud       // Draw volume as a cloud of dots.
  };
    and consequential augmentation of access function, test functions and
    stream output functions.
  o G4VisCommandsViewerSet.hh/cc
    . Add /vis/viewer/set/numberOfCloudPoints.
    . Augment /vis/viewer/set/style to handle "c[loud]".
    . Note: G4VisCommandsViewerSet.cc: Indentations recomputed (Xcode has
      a slightly different algorithm to emacs). Many hundreds of lines changed.
  o G4VSceneHandler::RequestPrimitives: Augmented to handle cloud.
  o G4VisCommandsCompound.cc: Augment message from /vis/drawLogicalVolume.
  o G4VisCommandsViewerDefault: Augment /vis/viewer/default/style.
- Other developments:
  o void G4VSceneHandler::AddPrimitive (const G4Polymarker& polymarker)
    Functionally unchanged but algorithmetically improved.
    Note, as stated above, OpenGL does not use this default function -
    it has its own version.

24 February 2019  John Allison
- Included in vis-V10-05-13
- Add /vis/touchable/extentForField and volumeForField.

  o Use G4BoundingExtentScene instead of G4BoundingSphereScene.
  o Use G4VisExtent::GetTransformedExtent to correct for fix to bug in
    G4PhysicalVolumeModel - see modeling/History.
- G4ViewParameters: Improve message.
- G4VisManager: Register the new commands.

13 February 2019  John Allison
- Included in vis-V10-05-11
- Implement /vis/set/extentForField - see visualisation/History.

10 February 2019  John Allison
- Included in vis-V10-05-10
- G4VisCommandsViewer:
  o Improved /vis/viewer/centreOn (it does not zoom).
  o Introduced /vis/viewer/centreAndZoomInOn.
- G4VisCommandsTouchable:
  o Improved /vis/touchable/centreOn (it does not zoom).
  o Introduced /vis/touchable/centreAndZoomInOn.
- G4VVisCommand:
  o Introduced utility functions CopyGuidanceFrom and CopyParametersFrom.
- G4VisCommandsCompound:
  o Made use of above-mentioned utility functions.

08 February 2019  John Allison
- Included in vis-V10-05-09
- Fix Coverity warnings.

31 January 2019  Michael Kelsey
- Included in vis-V10-05-08
- Provide ability to draw electric fields, and eventually any other field.
  Refactor G4MagneticFieldModel to have an intermediate base class, which
  implements DescribeYourselfTo().  Concrete class only implements a utility
  function to get value from field.  Add new G4ElectricFieldModel which does
  the same thing.  Add commands for the latter.

29 January 2019  John Allison
- Included in vis-V10-05-06
- G4VisCommandsTochable:
  o Add /vis/touchable/draw.
- G4VisCommandsViewer: /vis/viewer/centreOn:
  o Add copy number to parameter list.
- CheckSceneAndNotifyHandlers: move from xx to G4VVisCommand so that it
  can be used by any messenger.

26 January 2019  John Allison
- Included in vis-V10-05-06
- Fix calculation of vis extent for parameterisations.
- Some minor tidying.

25 January 2019  John Allison
- Included in vis-V10-05-06
- Rationalise view interpolation
  Encapsulate algorithm into base class G4VVisCommand. The commands
    /vis/viewer/interpolate
    /vis/viewer/centreOn
    /vis/touchable/centerOn
  now use this. Might consider use by all view changing commands.

25 January 2019  John Allison
- Included in vis-V10-05-05
- Include parameterised volumes in overlap checking and visualisation
  in G4LogicalVolumeModel (in addition to ordinary placements).

22 January 2019  John Allison
- Included in vis-V10-05-04
- Introduce /vis/viewer/centreOn and /vis/touchable/centreOn
  This allows one to centre the view (zoom in) on a volume.
  Reset with /vis/viewer/reset.
- Moved
    void SetViewParameters(G4VViewer* viewer, const G4ViewParameters& viewParams);
    void RefreshIfRequired(G4VViewer* viewer);
  from G4VisCommandsViewer to the higher level G4VVisCommand so that all
  vis commands may make use. In so doing eliminated the intermediate class
  G4VVisCommandViewer (which did not have a .hh file of its own and was anyhow
  obscurely buried in G4VisComandsViewer). Much cleaner now.

21 January 2019  John Allison
- Included in vis-V10-05-03.
- Pick up default number of line-segments-per-circle from G4Polyhedron.

08 January 2019  John Allison
- Correct History files after merge

02 January 2019  John Allison
- Included in vis-V10-05-01.
- Minor improvements to vis manager.
- Added confirmation printing when registering models with the scene.
- At start of run:
  // Check to see if the user has created a trajectory model. If not, create
  // a default one. To avoid code duplication the following function is used
  // and its result (a const G4VTrajectoryModel*) is thrown away at this point.
  // The function is called again later when needed.

02 January 2019  John Allison
- Included in vis-V10-05-00.
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Improve guidance for /vis/scene/add/volume.

14 November 2018  John Allison  (visman-V10-04-28)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: /vis/scene/add/userAction:
  o Fix bug whereby success was branded unsuccessful when verbosity <= warnings.
- G4VisCommandsCompound.cc: /vis/drawLogicalVolume:
  o Warn the user if style and/or hidden marker condition is changed.

08 November 2018  John Allison  (visman-V10-04-26)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc:
  o /vis/scene/add/logicalVolume:
    . Overlap checking now in text and drawing.

07 November 2018  John Allison  (visman-V10-04-25)
- G4VisCommandsTouchable.cc:
  o /vis/touchable/findPath: Correct a bug in guidance.
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc:
  o /vis/scene/add/logicalVolume:
    . Overlap checking only in text output at present.

24 October 2018  John Allison  (visman-V10-04-24)
- G4VVisCommand:
  o Replace fCurrentTouchablePath by fCurrentTouchableProperties.
- G4VisCommandsTouchableSet:
  o /vis/touchable/set/...:
    . Replace fCurrentTouchablePath by
      fCurrentTouchableProperties.fTouchablePath.
- G4VisCommandsTouchable:
  o /vis/touchable/dump: Simplify.
  o /vis/touchable/findPath: Add (see guidance for description).
- G4VisCommandSet:
  o /vis/set/touchable: Add validity check.
- G4VViewer:::TouchableSetColour, TouchableSetVisibility:
  o Conform to modeling-V10-04-15.

19 October 2018  John Allison  (visman-V10-04-23)
- Requires greps-V10-04-08: G4VisExtent::GetNullExtent().
- G4VSceneHandler::ProcessScene: Use G4VisExtent::GetNullExtent().
- G4VVisCommand: Replace
    UpdateVisManagerScene(const G4String& sceneName)
  by
    CheckSceneAndNotifyHandlers(G4Scene* pScene)
  and fix minor bug.
- G4VisCommandsScene.cc, G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc, G4VisCommandsViewer.cc:
  Migrate to CheckSceneAndNotifyHandlers.

17 October 2018  John Allison  (visman-V10-04-22)
- /vis/scene/add/volume (and, consequently, /vis/drawVolume):
  o Improve guidance: describe the use of a regular expression.
    If physical-volume-name is "world" (the default), the top of the
    main geometry tree (material world) is added.  If "worlds", the
    top of all worlds - material world and parallel worlds, if any - are
    added.  Otherwise a search of all worlds is made.
    In the last case (a search of all worlds) all physical volume names are
    matched against the first argument of this command.  If this is of the
    form "/regexp/", where regexp is a regular expression (see C++ regex),
    the physical volume name is matched against regexp by the usual rules
    of regular expression matching. Otherwise an exact match is required.
    For example, "/Shap/" matches "Shape1" and "Shape2".

15 October 2018  John Allison  (visman-V10-04-21)
- G4VSceneHandler.cc: Tidy.

8 October 2018  John Allison  (visman-V10-04-20)

  o Change G4UIcmdWithAString to G4UIcommand in /vis/drawVolume.

6 October 2018  John Allison  (visman-V10-04-19)
- G4VisManager.cc: Move creation of top level commands to end.
- /vis/drawVolume and /vis/draw/logicalVolume:
  o Pick up guidance and parameters from /vis/scene/add/...
- /vis/scene/add/trajectories: avoid adding new model if one exists.
  o If no trajectories model exists in the scene create a new one...
    ...else it already exists and there is no need to add a new one
    because G4TrajectoriesModel simply describes trajectories in the
    trajectories store whatever the type.

10 September 2018  John Allison  (visman-V10-04-18)
- G4VSceneHandler.cc: Tidy.
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: /vis/scene/add/volume:
  o Change to G4PhysicalVolumesSearchScene, which returns ALL occurrences
    of a physical volume.

  o /vis/viewer/colourByDensity: Change defaults:
    . Algorithm 1 is default.
    . gm/cm3 is default unit.
    . Subsequent parameters are not omitable.

12 July 2018  Gabriele Cosmo (visman-V10-04-12)
- G4VisManager: obtain geometry and solids workspaces through calls to
  the templated workspace pool class.
- Coworks with tags in geometry and run.

25 May 2018  John Allison (visman-V10-04-11)
- Introduce /vis/drawLogicalVolume:
  o Synonymous with /vis/specify.
  o Both commands create a new scene and invoke /vis/scene/add/logicalVolume.

24 May 2018  John Allison (visman-V10-04-10)
- /vis/specify, /vis/scene/add/logicalVolume:
  o Include overlap checking.

08 May 2018 Ben Morgan (visman-V10-04-09)
- G4VisCommandsMultithreading.cc:
  - Explicitly #include G4Types header before use
    of G4MULTITHREADED symbol. This prepares visman
    for migration from -D flags to explicit header-set
    #defines. It is backward compatible with old system.

25 April 2018  John Allison (visman-V10-04-08)
- G4VSceneHandler::CreateModelingParameters:
  o Copy colour-by-density to modeling parameters.

24 April 2018  John Allison (visman-V10-04-07)

  o Complete implementation of /vis/viewer/colourByDensity, e.g.,
    operator<<, etc.
  o Migrate to greps-V10-04-03.

22 April 2018  John Allison
- G4VisCommandsViewer, G4ViewParameters:
  o Add /vis/viewer/colourByDensity.

22 April 2018  John Allison (visman-V10-04-04)

8th January 2018  John Allison  (visman-V10-04-01)
- Merged timemovebranch:
  o Moved time window parameters from G4OpenGLStoredViewer to
    G4ViewParameters. Now one can interpolate time window parameters (using
    /vis/viewer/interpolate) and make a movie of particles moving through time.
  o See vis-V10-04-00 History for more details.

12th December 2017  John Allison  (visman-V10-04-00)
- G4ViewParameters.cc: Minor cosmetic.

29th October 2017  John Allison  (visman-V10-03-16)
- G4VisManager.cc: Protect /vis/enable issued before run established.

6th October 2017  John Allison  (visman-V10-03-15)
- Needs greps-V10-03-07.
- G4VisManager:
  o Remove
      if (!GetConcreteInstance()) return;
    from Begin/EndOfRun so that even if the user
      /vis/disable
    the vis manager will still report fully, for example, with information
    about the number of kept events for reviewing or redrawing.
  o Introduce InitialiseG4ColourMap, which initialises G4Colour's colour map
    and adds Guy Barrand's 65 X11 colours.
  o Improve some messages.
- G4VisCommands:
  o Change /vis/drawOnlyKeptEvents to /vis/drawOnlyToBeKeptEvents and
    improve the guidance for improved clarity.

13th September 2017  John Allison  (visman-V10-03-14)
- G4ViewParameters.cc, G4VisCommandsViewerSet.cc:
  Reverted default number of line segments per circle to 24.
  (72 lines per circle gives trouble in the Boolean Processor, so until that
  is fixed we revert to 24.)

21st June 2017  John Allison  (visman-V10-03-13)
- Implement /vis/drawOnlyKeptEvents.
  To draw selected events the user should set this flag, then in a user action:
    if ( some criterion ) {
      G4EventManager::GetEventManager()->KeepTheCurrentEvent();
    }

15th May 2017  John Allison
- Cosmetic.

14th May 2017  John Allison  (visman-V10-03-12)

  repeat it for every command that uses it.
- /vis/viewer/save: Add .g4view if an extension is not supplied by the user.
- /vis/viewer/set/defaultTextColour: Changed default to blue and opaque to
  agree with default text vis attributes.

11th May 2017  John Allison  (visman-V10-03-10)
- Added #include <cctype> for Windows compiler and removed where no
  longer necessary because isalpha is now encapsulated in
  G4VVisCommand::ConverToColour.

10th May 2017  John Allison  (visman-V10-03-09)
- Needs greps-V10-03-04.
- Added G4VVisCommand::ConvertToColour.

  o Tidied and improved error message for the case that a polyhedron
    pointer is null:
"\n  This means it cannot be visualized on most systems (try RayTracer)."
"\n  1) The solid may not have implemented the CreatePolyhedron method."
"\n  2) For Boolean solids, the BooleanProcessor, which attempts to create"
"\n     the resultant polyhedron, may have failed."

  o Moved G4Spline into G4VViewer to avoid polluting global namespace.
  o Fixed Coverity warnings.

23rd September 2016  John Allison (visman-V10-02-29)
- G4ViewParameters.cc: Removed accidental duplicate function, correctly
  defined in G4ModelingParameters.
std::ostream& operator <<
(std::ostream& os,
 const std::vector<G4ModelingParameters::VisAttributesModifier>& vams)

20th September 2016  John Allison (visman-V10-02-28)

13th September 2016  John Allison (visman-V10-02-25)
- Replace all r-value references, e.g., auto&&, with simple
  l-value references, e.g., const auto&, until I understand
  r-value references.  I think we do not yet have a need for
  r-value references!

12th September 2016  John Allison (visman-V10-02-24)
- G4VViewer:
  o Introduced
     void G4VViewer::SetTouchable
     (const std::vector<G4PhysicalVolumeModel::G4PhysicalVolumeNodeID>&
     fullPath)
  // Set the touchable for /vis/touchable/set/... commands.
  // This is harmless but useful if the user wishes immediately to
  // change or undo an operation on a touchable.

11th September 2016  John Allison (visman-V10-02-23)
- GetColour/GetColor no longer takes an argument.
- Make sure applicable vis attributes are obtained.
  // Get and check applicable vis attributes.
  //   fpVisAttribs = fpViewer->GetApplicableVisAttributes(fpVisAttribs);

- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: Fixed warning.

G4VisCommandViewerClone::SetNewValue
7th August 2016  John Allison (visman-V10-02-17 needs greps-V10-02-02)
- G4VSceneHandler.cc:
  o Improved GetAuxEdgeVisible to take account of new flag
    IsForceDrawingStyle.
- G4ViewParameters.cc:
  o Takes account of new flag IsForceDrawingStyle.
  o G4ViewParameters::TouchableCommands:
    Suppressed the saving of the following commands when not forced:
    /vis/touchable/set/forceWireframe
    /vis/touchable/set/forceSolid
    /vis/touchable/set/forceAuxEdgeVisible
    /vis/touchable/set/lineSegmentsPerCircle
- G4VisCommandsGeometrySet.cc:
  o Changed default to "true" for:
    /vis/geometry/set/daughtersInvisible
    /vis/geometry/set/forceAuxEdgeVisible
    /vis/geometry/set/forceSolid
    /vis/geometry/set/forceWireframe
    /vis/geometry/set/visibility (default was already "true")
  o Changed default from -1 to 0 for:
    /vis/geometry/set/forceLineSegmentsPerCircle
    (<= 0 means use global default value, so should not change anything.)
- G4VisCommandsTouchableSet.cc:

    /vis/touchable/set/visibility
  o Changed default from -1 to 0 for:
    /vis/touchable/set/lineSegmentsPerCircle
    (<= 0 means use global default value, so should not change anything.)

20th July 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-16)
- G4VisExecutive.icc: Replaced TouchedVolume by EncounteredVolume
  in trajectory drawing and filtering.  Functionally identical.
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: /vis/scene/add/axes: Fixed bug in guidance.
- G4VSceneHandler::AddPrimitive (const G4Scale& scale):
  Scale annotations now pick up current text colour.

30th June 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-15)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc:
  o Added comments to explain strategy for /vis/scene/add/logo.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: Fixed Coverity warning.

14th June 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-14)
- G4VisManager.cc:  Improved informational printing:

  o for /vis/disable and /vis/enable.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc:
  o Improved /vis/viewer/list.
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd:
  o Improved guidance regarding local axes for
    /vis/scene/add/logicalVolume
- G4VisCommandsCompound:
  o Improved guidance regarding local axes for /vis/specify.

3rd June 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-13)
- G4ViewParameters.cc: Fixed compilation warnings on gcc-6.1.

1st June 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-12)
- Fixed compiler error on Windows. /vis/viewer/interpolate is not
  available on Windows because it uses popen, a way of getting
  output from a system command. _popen (with an underscore) is
  said to be available in Windows but this has not been tried.
 
1st June 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-11)
- Introduced /vis/viewer/interpolate.  See History from development
  branch visman-V10-02-02-branch as follows:
17th February 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02-branch-12)
- G4ViewParameters::CatmullRomCubicSplineInterpolation:
  o Protected some parameters from going negative, as appropriate.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: /vis/viewer/interpolate:
  o Changed first argument to Unix-style pattern.  From the guidance:
    Interpolate views defined by the first argument, which can
    contain Unix-shell-style pattern matching characters such as
    '*', '?' and '[' - see "man sh" and look for "Pattern Matching".
    The contents of each file are assumed to be "/vis/viewer"
    commands that specify a particular view. The files are
    processed in alphanumeric order of filename. The files may be
    written by hand or produced by the "/vis/viewer/save" command.
    The default is to search the working directory for files with a
    .view (updated to .g4view, visman-V10-02-28) extension. Another
    procedure is to assemble view files in a subdirectory, e.g.,
    "myviews"; then they can be interpolated with
    "/vis/viewer/interpolate myviews/*".
16th February 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02-branch-11)
- /vis/viewer/interpolate:
  Added safety check to while and do loops.
- Restored mysteriously lost G4VisCommandViewerClearVisAttributesModifiers.
28th January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02-branch-10)

28th January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02-branch-09)
- Tidied.
28th January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02-branch-08)
- Interpolation: Added cutaway planes.
27th January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02-branch-07)
- Interpolation: Added planes and colours.
27th January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02-branch-06)
- /vis/viewer/interpolate:
  o Allow export of files for possible movie. Write \"export\" as
    5th parameter (OpenGL only).
27th January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02-branch-05)
- Needs modeling-V10-02-01.
- G4VisManager.cc: Added instantiation of
  G4VisCommandViewerClearVisAttributesModifiers.
- G4VisCommandsViewer: Added /vis/viewer/clearVisAttributesModifiers.
- G4VisCommandsTouchable.cc: Improved guidance.
- G4ViewParameters:
  o Added ClearVisAttributesModifiers.
  o Augmented AddVisAttributesModifier so that if a target already
    exists the modifier is not added, only the vis attributes of the
    existing modifier are changed.
26th January 2016  John Allison
- Merged visman-V10-02-03: G4VisManager::G4VisSubThread:
  GetNavigatorForTracking -> SetWorldVolume
  This is required for OriginVolume drawing and filtering. 
24th January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02-branch-04)
- Refinements.
23rd January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02-branch-01)
- Improved /vis/viewer/interpolate.
22nd January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02-branch-00)
- Introduced G4ViewParameters::CatmullRomCubicSplineInterpolation.
- Moved the following:
    #ifndef __MIC__
    #define G4VIS_USE_STD11
    #endif
  from G4VisManager.cc to G4VisManager.hh.
- G4VisManager.cc: Instantiated G4VisCommandViewerInterpolate.
- G4VisCommandsViewer:
  o Introduced /vis/viewer/interpolate.  Note this command is not
    available on Windows.  Code is protected by #ifndef WIN32.
    This is because popen, which allows one to retrieve output
    from a system shell command, is not available on Windows.
  o Improved guidance for /vis/viewer/save.

30th May 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-10)
- G4VisManager::SetCurrentViewer: Added fpViewer->SetView().
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc:
  o /vis/viewer/select: Added comment: Calling the above calls SetView().
  o /vis/viewer/clear: Added viewer->SetView().

4th May 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-09)
- G4VisExecutive.icc: Win32 now opens with "/vis/open OGL" if Qt
  is not built.

2nd May 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-08)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Fixed gcc-6.1 warnings.

2nd May 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-07)
- G4VisManager: MT mode: moved end of run instructions (ShowView,
  etc.) to end of vis thread.  This is so that all trajectories are
  flushed from vis thread before switching back to master thread.
  Also fixes picking in MT mode.

30th March 2016  John Allison
- Gave fallback trajectory model the name "DefaultModel".

29th March 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-06)
- G4VisManager.cc: Cosmetic. Change of name of fallback traj. model.
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc:
  o /vis/scene/add/volume: Removed incorrect check on existing models.
    It was preventing parallel worlds being added individually.  There
    are enough checks in G4Scene::AddRunDurationModel.

11th March 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-05)
- Fixed mistake in introductory vis manager message.
- Inhibited use of BeginRun, BeginEvent, EndEvent and EndRun
  when vis is not enabled, for example after /vis/disable.
  In particular this prevents the start of the vis thread in
  multithreading mode.

15th February 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-04)
- Requires modeling-V10-02-02.
- G4VisExecutive.icc:
  Registered drawing and filtering by touched volume.  I.e.,
    /vis/modeling/trajectories/create/drawByTouchedVolume
    /vis/filtering/trajectories/create/touchedVolumeFilter

26th January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-03)
- G4VisManager::G4VisSubThread:
  GetNavigatorForTracking -> SetWorldVolume
  This is required for OriginVolume drawing and filtering. 

14th January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02)
- Improved /vis/viewer/save.

14th January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-01)
- Fixed unused variable problem.

14th January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-00)
- Improved error tracking:
  o G4VVisCommand: Introduced error code to track error conditions.
  o G4VisCommandsCompound.cc: Tracked error conditions for
    /vis/open and /vis/drawTree.
- G4VisCommandsSceneHandler.cc: Code tidying.

11th December 2015 Laurent Garnier
- G4VViewer:
  o Add ComputeFlyThrough method (beta)
  o Add an G4Spline class for testing
    
1st November 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-20)
- Introduced (again!) <chrono> for queue handling in MT mode.
  o Except for Xeon Phi, which is protected by #ifndef __MIC__

15th October 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-19)
- G4VisManager.cc:
  o Corrected end-of-run printing for the case of 
  "/vis/multithreading/actionOnEventQueueFull discard".
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc:
  o Improved guidance and confirmation printing for /vis/viewer/save.

1st October 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-18)
- Co-works with modeling-V10-01-04.
- Added "light" representation to /vis/scene/add/magneticField.

1st October 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-17)
- Reverted (again!) to G4THREADSLEEP for queue handling in MT mode.
- Minor improvements in messages.

30th September 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-16)
- Uses <chrono> for queue handling in MT mode.
- New commands for multithreading:
  /vis/multithreading/actionOnEventQueueFull
  /vis/multithreading/maxEventQueueSize

19th August 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-15)
- Improvements to help and verbosity printing.

5th August 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-14)
- Reverted to G4THREADSLEEP for queue handling in MT mode.

1st August 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-13)
- Uses <chrono>.

1st August 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-12)
- G4VGraphicsSystem.cc, G4VisCommandsSceneHandler.cc, G4VisManager.cc:
  o Use auto&& (rather than auto or auto&).

30th July 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-11)
- Re-implemented graphics system fallback strategy.  A graphics system may
  have more than one nickname.  This is used for finding a fallback graphics
  systems when, for example, a Qt session is requested but the user has not
  instantiated a Qt session, or when interactive graphics systems are
  prohibited, as in batch mode.  This allows the user to run an application
  that is fully configured with all available graphics systems, even under
  circumstances for which the primary graphics system is inappropriate.  For
  example, it allows one to make a image with these commands in a batch macro:
    /vis/open OGL
    /vis/drawVolume
    /vis/ogl/export
- G4VGraphicsSystem:
  o Introduced vector of nicknames.
  o Introduced AddNickname method.
  o Removed: Set methods.  Data members are set in the constructor and
    may not be changed, except to add further nicknames with AddNickname.
  o GetNickname gets first element in nickname vector, which is, therefore,
    the primary nickname.  Other nicknames are used for fallback strategies
    so that fallback graphics systems can be used when, for example,
    interactive graphics systems are prohibited, as in batch mode.
  o Moved all inline functions to .hh.  Removed G4VGraphicsSystem.icc.
- G4VisManager, G4VisCommandSceneHandlerCreate, G4VisExecutive.icc
  o Re-implemented graphics system fallback strategy.
- /vis/scene/add/volume: Improved guidance.
- /vis/open: Simplified.
  o Handed on parameter checking to /vis/sceneHandler/create.
- G4ViewParameters::TouchableCommands: Bug fix.
  o Fixed bug whereby touchable changes where not properly dumped (with
    /vis/viewer/save) for re-reading into another viewer.
- G4VSceneHandler.cc: Simplified some code with C++11 features.

3rd June 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-10)
- G4VViewer and G4VisManager: Introduced
  // In MT mode these functions are called in the following order for each run:
  // Called on the master thread before starting the vis sub-thread.
  virtual void DoneWithMasterThread ();
  // Called on the master thread after starting the vis sub-thread.
  virtual void MovingToVisSubThread ();
  // Called on the vis sub-thread when waiting for events.
  virtual void SwitchToVisSubThread ();
  // Called on the vis sub-thread when all events have been processed.
  virtual void DoneWithVisSubThread ();
  // Called on the vis sub-thread when all events have been processed.
  virtual void MovingToMasterThread ();
  // Called on the master thread after the vis sub-thread has terminated.
  virtual void SwitchToMasterThread ();

27th May 2015  Laurent Garnier (visman-V10-01-09 co-works with opengl-V10-01-05)
- A bit of cleaning in managing OpenGL context (Qt)

26th May 2015  Laurent Garnier

20th March 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-08)
- G4VisManager.cc: Very minor tidying.

8th March 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-07)
- G4VisManager.cc: Tidied.
- G4VisCommandGeometryList::SetNewValue: Protected null vis att pointer.

1st March 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-06)
- G4VisManager.cc: Limited the use of G4USE_STD11 to the clang compiler for now.

3rd February 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-05)
- G4VisManager.cc: Introduced G4USE_STD11 and tidied.

2nd February 2015  Gabriele Cosmo  (visman-V10-01-04)
- Fix to sources.cmake script to include missing dependency on external library.

12th January 2015  Gabriele Cosmo  (visman-V10-01-03)
- Use G4THREADSLEEP(tick) macro from G4Threading.hh in G4VisManager.
- Requires tag "global-V10-01-01".

19th December 2014  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-02)
- Removed debug printing (MT mode).

16th December 2014  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-01)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Fixed /vis/scene/add/eventID for MT mode.

16th December 2014  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-00)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Improve guidance for /vis/scene/add/extent.

2nd December 2014  John Allison  (vis-MT-branch-00-man-18)
- G4VisManager.cc:
  o Tidied.
  o Removed the following from EndOfRun:
//    // ???? I can't remember why
//    // if (!fpSceneHandler->GetMarkForClearingTransientStore()) {
//    // is here.  It prevents ShowView at end of run, which seems to be OK
//    // for sequential mode, but MT mode seems to need it (I have not
//    // figured out why). ???? JA ????
//    if (!fpSceneHandler->GetMarkForClearingTransientStore()) {
  o Removed the following from EndOfRun:
//        // An extra refresh for auto-refresh viewers.
//        // ???? I DON'T THINK THIS IS NECESSARY ???? JA ????
//        if (fpViewer->GetViewParameters().IsAutoRefresh()) {
//          fpViewer->RefreshView();
//        }

1st December 2014  John Allison  (vis-MT-branch-00-man-17)
- G4VisManager.cc:
  o Moved KeepTheEvent from the vis sub-thread to EndOfEvent,
    where it should have been all along!!  :)

1st December 2014  John Allison  (vis-MT-branch-00-man-16)
- G4VisManager.cc: Prevented vis sub-thread for runs with no events.

30th November 2014  John Allison  (vis-MT-branch-00-man-15)
- Introduced DoneWithMaster/VisSubThread.

30th November 2014  John Allison  (vis-MT-branch-00-man-14)
- Rationalisation of vis sub-thread code and Begin/EndRun/Event.
- Elimination of (commented out) ShowView and extra refresh for
  auto-refresh viewers at end of run for accumulate mode.  Works
  well for stored sequential mode but in stored MT mode trajectories
  are drawn to the front buffer (as they should be) but they
  disappear on refresh, as though the display lists have not been
  made - or, perhaps made in another space?  Also, curiously,
  they are not cleared at the start of the next run (as they should
  be via ClearTransientStoreIfMarked).

28th November 2014  John Allison  (visman-V10-00-30)
- G4VSceneHandler.cc, G4VisCommands.cc, G4VisCommandsScene.cc,
  G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc:
  o Get correct run manager in MT mode:
  G4RunManager* runManager = G4RunManager::GetRunManager();
#ifdef G4MULTITHREADED
  if(G4Threading::IsMultithreadedApplication())
  { runManager = G4MTRunManager::GetMasterRunManager(); }
#endif

28th November 2014  John Allison  (visman-V10-00-29)
- G4VisManager.cc: Fixed Coverity warning.

26th November 2014  John Allison  (vis-MT-branch-00-man-13)
- G4VisManager.cc: Correct placement of fEventRefreshing = false.

22nd November 2014  John Allison  (vis-MT-branch-00-man-12)
- G4VisManager.cc: Minor tidying of #include’s.

22nd November 2014  John Allison  (vis-MT-branch-00-man-11)

  o Fixes for Coverity warnings.

11th November 2014  John Allison  (visman-V10-00-24)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: /vis/scene/add/scale:
  o Added full list of parameters to GlobalDescription of scale model.
    This is so that scales with different parameters can be added to a
    scene without being caught in the “model already exists” trap.

- Added /vis/set/maxEventQueueSize.
  If, during a multithreaded run, the simulation gets ahead of the
  visualisation by more than this maximum, the simulation is delayed
  until the vis sub-thread has drawn a few more events.  You may
  change this maximum number of events with
  "/vis/set/maxEventQueueSize <N>”, where N is the
  maximum number you wish to allow.  N <= 0 means "unlimited".
  To avoid visualisation altogether: “/vis/disable”.

    if endOfRunAction is "accumulate".
  o Small bug fix for MT mode:
    . fTransientsDrawnThisEvent should be reset for every event.

22nd November 2013  John Allison (visman-V09-06-27)
- G4VisManager.cc: Fix for end-of-run action "accumulate".
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Tidied.

21st November 2013  Makoto Asai (visman-V09-06-26)

4th November 2013  John Allison  (visman-V09-06-21)
- G4VisManager:
  o Keep events for MT-refresh mode.
  o Improve names and informationals.
- G4Scene: Initialise fMaxNumberOfKeptEvents to 100.
- G4VisCommandsScene.cc:
  o Allow user to specify the number of kept events in refresh mode. This
    has no effect in sequential mode but is used by MT:
    /vis/scene/endOfEventAction refresh <N>

3rd November 2013  John Allison  (visman-V09-06-20)
- G4VisManager: Further improvements to event keeping and informationals.

  o /vis/touchable/set/colour and several other commands:
    . Parameter guidance may be called only once. So instances of
      multiple calls to parameter guidance have been eliminated.
      Any extended information that was in parameter guidance has
      been moved to command guidance. This fixes a problem whereby
      guidance information was being lost and fixes a crash in the
      GAG interface.

14th October 2013 Laurent Garnier
  G4VisExecutive.icc: avoid mix with WT driver and GL2PS

    . Implemented maxNumberOfKeptEvents.
  o Cosmetics.

20th September 2013  John Allison  (visman-V09-06-15)

    G4VisManager::DispatchToModel.  This was a bug introduced during the
    elimination of i_mode.  Fixes Bug 1499 (whereby
    trajectory->DrawTrajectory() had stopped working).

10th June 2013  John Allison  (visman-V09-06-07)
- G4ViewParameters.cc: Migrated to modeling-V09-06-06:
  o Replaced PVNameCopyNoPathNotEqual by appropriate operator!=.

- G4VViewer:
  o Added new virtual function:
    virtual const std::vector<G4ModelingParameters::VisAttributesModifier>*
    GetPrivateVisAttributesModifiers() const;
    // So that privately accumulated vis attributes modifiers may be
    // concatenated with the standard vis attributes modifiers for commands
    // such as /vis/viewer/set/all and /vis/viewer/save.
    This returns zero by default, but if implemented in a subclass can be
    used to return vis attribute modifiers - e.g., see G4OpenGLQtViewer.
- /vis/viewer/save, /vis/viewer/set/all:
  o Temporarily concatenate the above private vis attribute modifiers for
    saving to standard output or file or copying to a viewer.  Does not
    modify the standard vis attribute modifiers of the current view.
- G4ViewParameters::TouchableCommands:
  o Improve writing of touchable commands for /vis/viewer/save.  If
    successive paths are equal, avoid repeating /vis/set/touchable.

29th May 2013  John Allison  (visman-V09-06-05)
- G4VisManager::RegisterEndOfRunUserVisAction:
  o Prevent storing of vis extent is radius <= 0.

3rd June 2012  John Allison  (visman-V09-05-19)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc/hh, G4VisCommandsGeometrySet.cc:
  o Coverity fixes.

23rd May 2012  John Allison  (visman-V09-05-18)
- Health Check 2012:
  o Over the years we have added drivers and features and added fixes.
    A health check revealed several instances of code duplication,
    unnecessary screen refeshing, incorrect buffer switching
    (necessitating extra refreshing), etc.  This tag is an attempt to
    bring the basic vis algorithms up to full health and efficiency.
  o G4VSceneHandler:
    . ClearStore and ClearTransientStore become "ordinary" virtual
      functions *not* requiring to be called by sub-class
      implementations.  The default implementation in G4VSceneHandler
      is an empty function.
    . ProcessScene:
      - Changed from a private function (called only by friend
        G4VViewer::ProcessView) to a straightforward protected virtual
        function that can be overloaded by the subclass.  A typical
        example of overloading is by
        G4OpenGLScenehandler::ProcessScene, which simply invokes the
        base class function twice, as is required for a good treatment
        of transparency, e.g.,
          void G4OpenGLSceneHandler::ProcessScene()
          {
            G4VSceneHandler::ProcessScene();
            // Repeat if required...
            if (fSecondPassRequested) {
              fSecondPass = true;
              G4VSceneHandler::ProcessScene();
              fSecondPass = false;
              fSecondPassRequested = false;
            }
          }
      - Now assumes graphics database store has already been cleared,
        i.e., ClearStore has been called.  ClearStore is now called
        from G4VViewer::ProcessView just before calling ProcessScene.
      - Existing call to ClearStore removed.
      - Second pass of run-duration models removed (in accordance with
        above change from private to protected virtual function).
      - Call to FinishView removed - this is the repsonsibility of the
        viewer.
  o G4VViewer::ProcessView: ClearStore before ProcessScene.
  o G4VisCommandsScene.cc:
    . /vis/scene/notifyHandlers:
      - Remove a superfluous call to
        ClearTransientStore and associated tentative comments.

22nd April 2012  John Allison  (visman-V09-05-17)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd: Fixed compiler warnings.

12th April 2012  John Allison
- G4VSceneHandler::ProcessScene: Moved FinishView to end.
- G4VisCommandsScene.cc:
  o The above is a fix of the "curious problem" in visman-V09-05-16.
  o Code reverted.
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd: /vis/scene/add/date:
  o G4Timer fTimer instantiated in constructor - more efficient.

- G4VSceneHandler.cc:
  o Augmented drawing loops to take account of model activation state.
- G4Scene.cc:
  o Improved CalculateExtent to take account of model activation state.
  o Tidied operator<<.
- G4VisCommandsScene.cc:
  o /vis/scene/notifyHandlers:
    . Instead of Set+Clear+DrawView, used ApplyCommand("/vis/viewer/refresh")
      twice!!  This was an attempt to fix a curious problem whereby
      trajectories were not refreshed.  Probably the go only to the
      back buffer, because a second refresh seems to do the trick.
  o /vis/scene/list: Improved. 
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: /vis/scene/add/userAction:
  o Small improvement to guidance and code readability.

10th April 2012  John Allison

- G4VisManager::RegisterRunDuration/EndOfEvent/EndOfRunUserVisAction.
  Now you can register any number of named vis actions and associate
  them with particular types of action.  They are added to the scene
  with /vis/scene/add/userAction [<name>] (default all).

8th April 2012  John Allison  (visman-V09-05-13)
- Added /vis/viewer/copyViewFrom.
- G4VisManager.hh: Tidy.
- G4VisCommandsSceneAddUserAction: Tidy model name.

8th April 2012  John Allison  (visman-V09-05-12)
- Added /vis/set/colour and /vis/set/lineWidth.  (/vis/set/ commands
  set "current quantities" for future /vis/scene/add/ commands.)
- /vis/scene/add/frame: Modified to use the above "current quantities".

5th April 2012  John Allison
- G4Scene::CalculateExtent: Include validation of models.  This
  re-calculated extent.  Solves problem of change of extent if a
  volume chnages visibility, for example, by a /vis/geometry command.
- /vis/scene/notifyHandlers:
  o Fix warning message if no scene exists.
  o Call G4Scene::CalculateExtent to ensure extent is up to date.

23rd March 2012  John Allison  (visman-V09-05-09.  Needs greps-V09-05-06.)
- Added /vis/set/textLayout and tidied.
- Modified list of "current quantities" for vis commands.
  From G4VVisCommands.hh:
  // Current quantities for use in appropriate commands
  static G4Colour                   fCurrentColour;
  static G4Colour                   fCurrentTextColour;
  static G4Text::Layout             fCurrentTextLayout;
  static G4double                   fCurrentLineThickness;
  static G4VisAttributes::LineStyle fCurrentLineStyle;
  static G4VMarker::FillStyle       fCurrentFillStyle;
  static G4VMarker::SizeType        fCurrentSizeType;
  The default values are (from G4VVisCommands.cc):
  G4VVisCommand::fCurrentColour = G4Colour::White();
  G4VVisCommand::fCurrentTextColour = G4Colour::Blue();
  G4VVisCommand::fCurrentTextLayout = G4Text::left;
  G4VVisCommand::fCurrentLineThickness = 1.;
  G4VVisCommand::fCurrentLineStyle = G4VisAttributes::unbroken;
  G4VVisCommand::fCurrentFillStyle = G4VMarker::filled;
  G4VVisCommand::fCurrentSizeType = G4VMarker::screen;

21st March 2012  John Allison  (visman-V09-05-08)
- Introduced concept of "current quantities" for use in vis commands.
- Added /vis/set/textColour, the first command in the series that
  will allow the user to change the above current quantities for use by
  subsequent commands.
- Some tidying of the vis command structure:
  o Moved /vis/default/ to /vis/viewer/default/ (it is specific to viewers).
- Files removed:
  o G4VisCommandsDefault.hh/cc
- New files:
  o G4VisCommandsViewerDefault.hh/cc
  o G4VisCommandsSet.hh/cc

7th March 2012  John Allison  (visman-V09-05-07)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd:
  o Added /vis/scene/add/logo2D and text2D.

    . Size computed automatically by default.
  o /vis/scene/add/date:
    . Placed left-adjusted to centre of screen pending implementation
      of right-adjustment.

- Merged vis-V09-05-04-2ndbranch (tag vis-V09-05-04-2ndbranch-08) to trunk.

9th February 2012  John Allison (visman-V09-05-03)
- Needs global-V09-05-00 (for date).
- Added /vis/scene/add/date and /vis/scene/add/frame.
- /vis/scene/add/eventID: Added layout parameter.

17th January 2012  Laurent Garnier
- Removed ProcessText.

13th January 2012  John Allison (visman-V09-05-02)
- Tagged.

3rd January 2012 Laurent Garnier
- G4VSceneHandler : Add ProcessText method in order to draw text

3rd January 2012  John Allison (visman-V09-05-01)
- G4VisCommandsScene.cc: /vis/scene/notifyHandlers:
  o Downgraded "scene has changed" from WARNING to NOTE. 

2nd January 2012  John Allison
- G4VisManager::EndOfEvent: Removed unwarranted DrawView.  It was
  causing two copies of the geometry to be drawn.

30th December 2011  John Allison  (visman-V09-05-00)
- G4VisManager: Implemented Begin/EndDraw(2D).
  o Note that this forces all thus-bracketed Draw messages to have the
    same transformation.  If an attempt to change the transformation
    is detected, a fatal exception is raised.
- G4VSceneHandler: Added Get/SetObjectTransformation.

12th December 2011  John Allison
- G4VSceneHandler::GetMarkerSize: Bug fix:
  o Bug: If size < 1., size = 1. for all markers.
  o Fix: Applies only to "screen-size" markers.
- G4VisCommandSceneAddLogo: Improvements to /vis/scene/add/logo:
  o In "auto" mode, logo is placed front-bottom-right facing the viewer
    regardless of currenrt viewpoint direction.  (Many examples set the
    viewpoint direction to (-1,0,0) so that the y-axis is up and the
    z-axis horizontal; the beam is usually fired down the z-axis.  This
    improvement puts the G4 logo in a sensible place.)
  o More choices for facing direction:
    . auto|[-]x|[-]y|[-]z - defaults to auto
    . If automatic, faces the user.

12th November 2011  John Allison  (visman-V09-04-12)
- G4VisListManager<T>::SetCurrent:
  o Changed "Fatal" to "JustWarning" for non-existent model.

  o /vis/list prints available colours.

30th October 2011  John Allison  (visman-V09-04-07)
- G4VisManager:
  o Added Get/SetDefaultViewParameters.
  o These are used by viewers during instantiation.
  o This allows you to set defaults for future operations.
  o You can do this in code or by commands.  In code, e.g., where you
    instantiate the vis manager:
      G4VisManager* visManager = new G4VisExecutive;
      // You can change the default view parameters, i.e., those used on
      // instantiation of a viewer.  First instantiate a view parameters
      // object with default values (e.g., it would draw in wireframe mode).
      G4ViewParameters vp;
      // Change drawing style to "Draw surfaces - hidden surfaces removed".
      vp.SetDrawingStyle(G4ViewParameters::hsr);
      // Make this default for all new viewers.
      visManager->SetDefaultViewParameters(vp);
      visManager->Initialize();
- G4VisCommandsDefault:
  o Added /vis/default/hiddenEdge and /vis/default/style.
  o Sets defaults for future viewers.
- G4VViewer.cc:
  o Pick up default view parameters from vis manager.

  (/vis/scene/add/trajectories) print attributes even if warnings
  are suppressed.
- Migrated to new G4Exception.

21st and 30th June 2011  John Allison
- Added /vis/viewer/set/rotationStyle
  Guidance :
  Set style of rotation - constrainUpDirection or freeRotation.

- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: /vis/scene/add/trajectories:
  o If >= warnings, print available attributes in all cases.
- G4VisCommandsScene.cc: /vis/scene/notifyHandlers:
  o Flag kernel visit in all cases.
- G4VisListManager.hh:
  o In case of model with existing name, instead of G4Exception, simply
    replace.

- Added /vis/viewer/set/defaultColour and /vis/viewer/set/defaultTextColour.

3rd September 2010  Gabriele Cosmo  (visman-V09-03-11)
- Added missing inclusion of <sstream> header in G4ViewParameters.cc.

15th June 2010  John Allison  (visman-V09-03-10)
- G4VisCommandsGeometrySet.hh: Added virtual destructors to fix
  compilation warnings.
- G4VisCommandsGeometrySet.cc: Changed "/vis/viewer/rebuild" to
  "/vis/scene/notifyHandlers", the command to be executed after a
  "/vis/geometry/..." command.  "/vis/scene/notifyHandlers" causes
  rebuild if viewer is "auto-refresh", otherwiae a message advises a
  rebuild.  This prevents over-enthusiatic rebuildin.

3rd June 2010  John Allison  (visman-V09-03-09)
- G4VisManager.cc: Checked valid view in DispatchToModel.
- Changed /vis/scene/add/digiti[sz]ations to /vis/scene/add/digis.

1st June 2010  John Allison  (visman-V09-03-07)

  o Moved i-mode deprecation warning to G4VTrajectory.
- G4VSceneHandler.cc:
  o Moved i-mode deprecation warning to G4VTrajectory.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: /vis/viewer/rebuild:

28th May 2010  John Allison  (visman-V09-03-04)
- G4VisManager, G4VisExecutive:
  Introduced optional verbosity string argument in constructor.  You
  can now write, for example:
    G4VisManager* visManager = new G4VisExecutive("quiet");
  Note that the default is "warnings":
    G4VisManager* visManager = new G4VisExecutive;

28th May 2010  John Allison  (visman-V09-03-03)
- Co-works interfaces-V09-03-04.
- G4VisExecutive.icc: Change order of flags to follow G4UIExecutive.

26th May 2010  John Allison  (visman-V09-03-02)
- G4VisExecutive.icc: Added drivers with generic nicknames:
  o OGL, OGLI, OGLS, OI.
  o The specific driver depends on G4VIS_USE and G4UI_USE flags.  So,
    for example, "/vis/open OGL" might open an OGLSX window on X or an
    OGLSWin32 on Windows.  It means that example vis.mac scripts can
    be written with this generic command that will work on all systems
    and all user choices.  In particular, it will open an OGLSQt
    window in a G4UIQt session.

20th May 2010  John Allison  (visman-V09-03-01)
- G4VisCommandsCompound.cc: Restore previous viewer after /vis/drawTree.

    otherwise calls DrawAllHits.
- G4VisManager.cc: Call fpSceneHandler->DrawEndOfRunModels at end of run.
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd: Added optional parameter:

- G4VSceneHandler:
  o Added default AddCompound (const G4THitsMap<G4double>&) methods.
    (For time being just issues warning.)

- Minor improvements:
  o G4VisManager: Removed event count (not used).
  o G4VSceneHandler: Inhibited drawing when vis disabled.
  o Various /vis/scene commands: Added update statement so that
    handlers are notified after change of scene.  Forces rebuild and
    refresh of all viewers using current scene.

12th November 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-01-08-06)
- Further iteration of event refreshing:
  o G4VisManager:

- Removed /vis/scene/transientsAction.  Now event keeping by the vis
  manager is automatic if there is a valid scene.  If the user issues
  "/vis/scene/endOfEventAction accumulate [<N>]", events are kept up
  to a maximum N in number (N<0 means unlimited, the default value is
  100).  Otherwise just the last event is kept.

- /vis/drawVolume and /vis/specify: Suppress all but first warning about
  needing to refresh for viewers that are not auto refresh.
- G4VScenehandler.cc: Remove warning about emepty scene.  (Subsequent action
  is to add a world, if empty - reasonable behaviour.)

5th November 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-01-08-01)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Improved implementation of parallel worlds.  Gets
  material world = *(transportationManager->GetWorldsIterator()) in all cases

- G4ViewParameters:
  o Added GlobalLineWidthScale.
  o Removed IsViewGeom/Hits/Digis (functionality available in G4Scene).

14th August 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-01-02)
- G4VisManager.hh: Added some OpenGL friends.
- G4VisCommandsCompound.cc: /vis/drawVolume: re-ordered "attach"

26th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-04)
- G4VViewer: Removed fModified.  It was used to flag a change of view
  parameters but it was only ever used negatively, i.e., to *prevent*
  its effect of invoking SetView.  So it has been removed and the
  responsibility for calling SetView after a change of view parameters
  rests with the user (e.g., the vis commands).  Only used by OpenGL
  and OpenInventor; now works with opengl-V08-00-01 and
  openinventor-V08-00-00.
- G4VSceneHandler.hh: Improved comments.
- G4VisListManager.hh: Prevent crash on attempt to Print when nothing

- G4VisExecutive.icc: protected with G4VISEXECUTIVE_ICC.
- G4VisManager.hh: prepared for RayTracer reorganisation (friend status).
- G4VisCommandsScene.cc: /vis/scene/create: simplified registration of
  scene to avoid recursive invocation of /vis/scene/notifyHandlers/.
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Improved message when world not available.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: /vis/viewer/refresh: When world added, delegate
  to /vis/scene/notifyHandlers.  Avoids double refresh.
- G4VisManager.cc: Changed ERROR to WARNING when user calls Draw with
  invalid view.

9th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-01)

5th January 2006  John Allison
- G4VSceneHandler.cc: Reversed change of 22nd November 2005:
  fMarkForClearingTransientStore(true) initially now.  This is so that
  at end of event or run, the view is refreshed and the scene
  (detector geometry, etc.) is drawn or written to file.

14th December 2005  John Allison
- Improved /vis/scene/notifyHandlers so that it forces a rebuild of the
  graphical database, if any.  Particularly relevant for Open Inventor.
- G4Scene.cc, G4VSceneHandler.cc: Improved warning messages.
- G4VisManager.cc: Apply "/vis/scene/notifyHandlers" if world has been added
  to an empty scene.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: "/vis/viewer/refresh": if world is added to
  an empty scene, invoke UpdateVisManagerScene, which applies
  "/vis/scene/notifyHandlers", which now forces a rebuild.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: Fix bug in "/vis/viewer/rebuild".

4th December  John Allison (visman-V07-01-10)
- G4Vismanager.cc: Prevent ERROR messages at end of event and run when
  user has not instantiated a scene handler, e.g., in batch mode.

29th November 2005  Jane Tinslay
