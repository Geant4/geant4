4th December  John Allison (visman-V07-01-10)
- G4Vismanager.cc: Prevent ERROR messages at end of event and run when
  user has not instantiated a scene handler, e.g., in batch mode.

29th November 2005  Jane Tinslay
- Make G4VisManager::RegisterModelFactories() non-pure for 
  backwards compatibility.
- Add information message to G4VisManager::DispatchToModel when default trajectory
  model is used.

23rd November 2005  Joseph Perl  (visman-V07-01-09)
- Tagged in preparation for Geant4 8.0

23rd November 2005 Jane Tinslay
- Enhanced trajectory implementation

22nd November John Allison
- Added /vis/viewer/rebuild (forces visit of kernel).
- Changed G4Transform3D::Identity to G4Transform3D().
- Tidied initial printing.
- Removed MyVisManager (was deprecated in previous major release).
- G4VSceneHandler.cc: fMarkForClearingTransientStore(false) initially.
- G4VVisCommand.cc: Improved UpdateVisManagerScene.
- Refined guidance of issue "/tracking/storeTrajectory 1" on
  "/vis/scene/add/trajectories".
- Improved /vis/sceneHandler/attach.
- G4VisManager.cc: Improved comments.

13th October 2005  John Allison  (visman-V07-01-08)
- G4ViewParameters: Added XGeometryString.
- G4VViewer.cc: Pick up XGeometryString.
- /vis/open and /vis/viewer/create: Allow X-Windows-type geometry string
  in window size hints.
- /vis/viewer/set/background: Add opacity parameter.

20th October 2005  John Allison  (visman-V07-01-07)
- G4VisManager:
  o Added methods for managing trajectory models.
  o Implemented first version of DispatchToCurrentModel(const G4VTrajectory&,
    G4int i_mode).
  o Created /vis/modeling/trajectories/ for trajectory model messengers.
  o Added XGeometryString for some future viewer enhancements.
- G4VisExecutive: Added RegisterTrajectoryModelMakers.

20th October 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-06)
- Get standard colours with "/vis/viewer/set/background red", for example.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: Fixed G4ThreeVector/G4Vector3D problem with
  CLHEP-1.9.2.1.

13th October 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-05)
- Background colour - /vis/viewer/set/background.
- Non-uniform scaling - /vis/viewer/scale and scaleTo.
- Migrated to <sstream>.

12th October 2005  John Allison (vis-V07-01-03)
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: Trapped zero viewer pointer in /vis/viewer/update
  (bug found by system test of vis-V07-01-02).

16th September 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-04)
- Simplified use of ConcreteInstance.  It is now always non-zero for
  an instantiated vis manager; invalid views are reported by the vis
  manager.  The exception is /vis/disable which zeros it; /vis/enable
  or any valid command resets it.

16th September 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-03)
- Issue "/tracking/storeTrajectory 1" on /vis/scene/add/trajectories.
- Added warning:
  o Attempt to add volume to a scene already containing the world.
- Added error message:
  o Logical volume model must be only volume model in scene.
- G4Scene.cc: Improvement - no functional change.

13th September 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-02)
- Added WhiteBackground to G4ViewParameters.
- Added /vis/viewer/set/whiteBackground.
- G4VSceneHandler::GetColour and GetTextColour: white and opaque
  objects on a white background are changed to black.
- Added RayTracerX to G4VisExecutive under control of G4VIS_USE_RAYTRACERX.
- Re-instated invocation of SetView and ClearView in /vis/viewer/refresh.

2nd September 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-01)
- Introduced optional second pass over run-duration models in
  G4VSceneHandler::ProcessScene.

20th July 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-00)
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: Protected new viewer pointer.

7th June 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-00-02)
- /vis/scene/notifyHandlers: Fixed case of scene handler with no viewer.

31st May 2005  John Allison  (visman-V07-00-01)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Fixed /vis/scene/add/text to accept text
  with spaces.
- G4ViewParameters.cc: Printed WARNING: Viewpoint direction is very
  close to the up vector direction.
