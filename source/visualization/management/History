  r-value references!

12th September 2016  John Allison (visman-V10-02-24)
- G4VViewer:
  o Introduced
     void G4VViewer::SetTouchable
     (const std::vector<G4PhysicalVolumeModel::G4PhysicalVolumeNodeID>&
     fullPath)
  // Set the touchable for /vis/touchable/set/... commands.
  // This is harmless but useful if the user wishes immediately to
  // change or undo an operation on a touchable.

11th September 2016  John Allison (visman-V10-02-23)
- GetColour/GetColor no longer takes an argument.
- Make sure applicable vis attributes are obtained.

- G4VSceneHandler.cc:
  o Improved GetAuxEdgeVisible to take account of new flag
    IsForceDrawingStyle.
- G4ViewParameters.cc:
  o Takes account of new flag IsForceDrawingStyle.
  o G4ViewParameters::TouchableCommands:
    Suppressed the saving of the following commands when not forced:

  in trajectory drawing and filtering.  Functionally identical.
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: /vis/scene/add/axes: Fixed bug in guidance.
- G4VSceneHandler::AddPrimitive (const G4Scale& scale):
  Scale annotations now pick up current text colour.

  o Improved guidance regarding local axes for /vis/specify.

3rd June 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-13)
- G4ViewParameters.cc: Fixed compilation warnings on gcc-6.1.

1st June 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-12)
- Fixed compiler error on Windows. /vis/viewer/interpolate is not
  available on Windows because it uses popen, a way of getting
  output from a system command. _popen (with an underscore) is
  said to be available in Windows but this has not been tried.
 
1st June 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-11)
- Introduced /vis/viewer/interpolate.  See History from development
  branch visman-V10-02-02-branch as follows:
17th February 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02-branch-12)
- G4ViewParameters::CatmullRomCubicSplineInterpolation:
  o Protected some parameters from going negative, as appropriate.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: /vis/viewer/interpolate:
  o Changed first argument to Unix-style pattern.  From the guidance:
    Interpolate views defined by the first argument, which can
    contain Unix-shell-style pattern matching characters such as
    '*', '?' and '[' - see "man sh" and look for "Pattern Matching".
    The contents of each file are assumed to be "/vis/viewer"
    commands that specify a particular view. The files are
    processed in alphanumeric order of filename. The files may be
    written by hand or produced by the "/vis/viewer/save" command.
    The default is to search the working directory for files with a
    .view (updated to .g4view, visman-V10-02-28) extension. Another
    procedure is to assemble view files in a subdirectory, e.g.,
    "myviews"; then they can be interpolated with
    "/vis/viewer/interpolate myviews/*".
16th February 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02-branch-11)
- /vis/viewer/interpolate:
  Added safety check to while and do loops.
- Restored mysteriously lost G4VisCommandViewerClearVisAttributesModifiers.
28th January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02-branch-10)

- Tidied.
28th January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02-branch-08)
- Interpolation: Added cutaway planes.
27th January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02-branch-07)
- Interpolation: Added planes and colours.
27th January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02-branch-06)
- /vis/viewer/interpolate:
  o Allow export of files for possible movie. Write \"export\" as
    5th parameter (OpenGL only).
27th January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02-branch-05)
- Needs modeling-V10-02-01.
- G4VisManager.cc: Added instantiation of
  G4VisCommandViewerClearVisAttributesModifiers.
- G4VisCommandsViewer: Added /vis/viewer/clearVisAttributesModifiers.
- G4VisCommandsTouchable.cc: Improved guidance.
- G4ViewParameters:
  o Added ClearVisAttributesModifiers.
  o Augmented AddVisAttributesModifier so that if a target already
    exists the modifier is not added, only the vis attributes of the
    existing modifier are changed.
26th January 2016  John Allison
- Merged visman-V10-02-03: G4VisManager::G4VisSubThread:
  GetNavigatorForTracking -> SetWorldVolume
  This is required for OriginVolume drawing and filtering. 
24th January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02-branch-04)
- Refinements.
23rd January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02-branch-01)
- Improved /vis/viewer/interpolate.
22nd January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-02-branch-00)
- Introduced G4ViewParameters::CatmullRomCubicSplineInterpolation.
- Moved the following:
    #ifndef __MIC__
    #define G4VIS_USE_STD11
    #endif
  from G4VisManager.cc to G4VisManager.hh.
- G4VisManager.cc: Instantiated G4VisCommandViewerInterpolate.
- G4VisCommandsViewer:
  o Introduced /vis/viewer/interpolate.  Note this command is not
    available on Windows.  Code is protected by #ifndef WIN32.
    This is because popen, which allows one to retrieve output
    from a system shell command, is not available on Windows.
  o Improved guidance for /vis/viewer/save.

30th May 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-10)
- G4VisManager::SetCurrentViewer: Added fpViewer->SetView().
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc:
  o /vis/viewer/select: Added comment: Calling the above calls SetView().
  o /vis/viewer/clear: Added viewer->SetView().

4th May 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-09)
- G4VisExecutive.icc: Win32 now opens with "/vis/open OGL" if Qt
  is not built.

2nd May 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-08)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Fixed gcc-6.1 warnings.

2nd May 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-07)
- G4VisManager: MT mode: moved end of run instructions (ShowView,
  etc.) to end of vis thread.  This is so that all trajectories are
  flushed from vis thread before switching back to master thread.
  Also fixes picking in MT mode.

30th March 2016  John Allison
- Gave fallback trajectory model the name "DefaultModel".

29th March 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-06)
- G4VisManager.cc: Cosmetic. Change of name of fallback traj. model.
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc:
  o /vis/scene/add/volume: Removed incorrect check on existing models.
    It was preventing parallel worlds being added individually.  There
    are enough checks in G4Scene::AddRunDurationModel.

11th March 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-05)
- Fixed mistake in introductory vis manager message.
- Inhibited use of BeginRun, BeginEvent, EndEvent and EndRun
  when vis is not enabled, for example after /vis/disable.
  In particular this prevents the start of the vis thread in
  multithreading mode.

15th February 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-04)
- Requires modeling-V10-02-02.
- G4VisExecutive.icc:
  Registered drawing and filtering by touched volume.  I.e.,
    /vis/modeling/trajectories/create/drawByTouchedVolume
    /vis/filtering/trajectories/create/touchedVolumeFilter

26th January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-03)
- G4VisManager::G4VisSubThread:
  GetNavigatorForTracking -> SetWorldVolume
  This is required for OriginVolume drawing and filtering.

- Improved /vis/viewer/save.

14th January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-01)
- Fixed unused variable problem.

14th January 2016  John Allison  (visman-V10-02-00)
- Improved error tracking:

  o G4VisCommandsCompound.cc: Tracked error conditions for
    /vis/open and /vis/drawTree.
- G4VisCommandsSceneHandler.cc: Code tidying.

11th December 2015 Laurent Garnier
- G4VViewer:
  o Add ComputeFlyThrough method (beta)
  o Add an G4Spline class for testing
    
1st November 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-20)
- Introduced (again!) <chrono> for queue handling in MT mode.
  o Except for Xeon Phi, which is protected by #ifndef __MIC__

15th October 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-19)
- G4VisManager.cc:
  o Corrected end-of-run printing for the case of 
  "/vis/multithreading/actionOnEventQueueFull discard".
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc:
  o Improved guidance and confirmation printing for /vis/viewer/save.

1st October 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-18)
- Co-works with modeling-V10-01-04.
- Added "light" representation to /vis/scene/add/magneticField.

1st October 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-17)
- Reverted (again!) to G4THREADSLEEP for queue handling in MT mode.
- Minor improvements in messages.

30th September 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-16)
- Uses <chrono> for queue handling in MT mode.
- New commands for multithreading:
  /vis/multithreading/actionOnEventQueueFull
  /vis/multithreading/maxEventQueueSize

19th August 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-15)
- Improvements to help and verbosity printing.

5th August 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-14)
- Reverted to G4THREADSLEEP for queue handling in MT mode.

1st August 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-13)
- Uses <chrono>.

1st August 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-12)
- G4VGraphicsSystem.cc, G4VisCommandsSceneHandler.cc, G4VisManager.cc:
  o Use auto&& (rather than auto or auto&).

30th July 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-11)
- Re-implemented graphics system fallback strategy.  A graphics system may
  have more than one nickname.  This is used for finding a fallback graphics
  systems when, for example, a Qt session is requested but the user has not
  instantiated a Qt session, or when interactive graphics systems are
  prohibited, as in batch mode.  This allows the user to run an application
  that is fully configured with all available graphics systems, even under
  circumstances for which the primary graphics system is inappropriate.  For
  example, it allows one to make a image with these commands in a batch macro:
    /vis/open OGL
    /vis/drawVolume
    /vis/ogl/export
- G4VGraphicsSystem:
  o Introduced vector of nicknames.
  o Introduced AddNickname method.
  o Removed: Set methods.  Data members are set in the constructor and
    may not be changed, except to add further nicknames with AddNickname.
  o GetNickname gets first element in nickname vector, which is, therefore,
    the primary nickname.  Other nicknames are used for fallback strategies
    so that fallback graphics systems can be used when, for example,
    interactive graphics systems are prohibited, as in batch mode.
  o Moved all inline functions to .hh.  Removed G4VGraphicsSystem.icc.
- G4VisManager, G4VisCommandSceneHandlerCreate, G4VisExecutive.icc
  o Re-implemented graphics system fallback strategy.
- /vis/scene/add/volume: Improved guidance.
- /vis/open: Simplified.
  o Handed on parameter checking to /vis/sceneHandler/create.
- G4ViewParameters::TouchableCommands: Bug fix.
  o Fixed bug whereby touchable changes where not properly dumped (with
    /vis/viewer/save) for re-reading into another viewer.
- G4VSceneHandler.cc: Simplified some code with C++11 features.

3rd June 2015  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-10)
- G4VViewer and G4VisManager: Introduced
  // In MT mode these functions are called in the following order for each run:
  // Called on the master thread before starting the vis sub-thread.
  virtual void DoneWithMasterThread ();
  // Called on the master thread after starting the vis sub-thread.
  virtual void MovingToVisSubThread ();
  // Called on the vis sub-thread when waiting for events.
  virtual void SwitchToVisSubThread ();
  // Called on the vis sub-thread when all events have been processed.
  virtual void DoneWithVisSubThread ();
  // Called on the vis sub-thread when all events have been processed.
  virtual void MovingToMasterThread ();
  // Called on the master thread after the vis sub-thread has terminated.
  virtual void SwitchToMasterThread ();

- Removed debug printing (MT mode).

16th December 2014  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-01)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Fixed /vis/scene/add/eventID for MT mode.

16th December 2014  John Allison  (visman-V10-01-00)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Improve guidance for /vis/scene/add/extent.

2nd December 2014  John Allison  (vis-MT-branch-00-man-18)
- G4VisManager.cc:
  o Tidied.
  o Removed the following from EndOfRun:
//    // ???? I can't remember why
//    // if (!fpSceneHandler->GetMarkForClearingTransientStore()) {
//    // is here.  It prevents ShowView at end of run, which seems to be OK
//    // for sequential mode, but MT mode seems to need it (I have not
//    // figured out why). ???? JA ????
//    if (!fpSceneHandler->GetMarkForClearingTransientStore()) {
  o Removed the following from EndOfRun:
//        // An extra refresh for auto-refresh viewers.
//        // ???? I DON'T THINK THIS IS NECESSARY ???? JA ????
//        if (fpViewer->GetViewParameters().IsAutoRefresh()) {
//          fpViewer->RefreshView();
//        }

1st December 2014  John Allison  (vis-MT-branch-00-man-17)
- G4VisManager.cc:
  o Moved KeepTheEvent from the vis sub-thread to EndOfEvent,
    where it should have been all along!!  :)

1st December 2014  John Allison  (vis-MT-branch-00-man-16)
- G4VisManager.cc: Prevented vis sub-thread for runs with no events.

30th November 2014  John Allison  (vis-MT-branch-00-man-15)
- Introduced DoneWithMaster/VisSubThread.

30th November 2014  John Allison  (vis-MT-branch-00-man-14)
- Rationalisation of vis sub-thread code and Begin/EndRun/Event.
- Elimination of (commented out) ShowView and extra refresh for
  auto-refresh viewers at end of run for accumulate mode.  Works
  well for stored sequential mode but in stored MT mode trajectories
  are drawn to the front buffer (as they should be) but they
  disappear on refresh, as though the display lists have not been
  made - or, perhaps made in another space?  Also, curiously,
  they are not cleared at the start of the next run (as they should
  be via ClearTransientStoreIfMarked).

28th November 2014  John Allison  (visman-V10-00-30)
- G4VSceneHandler.cc, G4VisCommands.cc, G4VisCommandsScene.cc,
  G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc:
  o Get correct run manager in MT mode:
  G4RunManager* runManager = G4RunManager::GetRunManager();
#ifdef G4MULTITHREADED
  if(G4Threading::IsMultithreadedApplication())
  { runManager = G4MTRunManager::GetMasterRunManager(); }
#endif

- G4VisManager.cc: Minor tidying of #include’s.

22nd November 2014  John Allison  (vis-MT-branch-00-man-11)
- Merged visman-V10-00-28 into MT version.

21st November 2014  John Allison  (visman-V10-00-28)

- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: /vis/scene/add/scale:
  o Added full list of parameters to GlobalDescription of scale model.
    This is so that scales with different parameters can be added to a
    scene without being caught in the “model already exists” trap.

- G4Scene.cc, G4VisManager.cc: Fixed spelling mistake in message.
- G4ViewParameters.icc: Fixed win7-vc12 compiler warnings.

8th November 2014  John Allison  (vis-MT-branch-00-man-10)

- G4ViewParameters.icc: Fix win7-vc12 compiler warnings.

2nd November 2014  John Allison  (vis-MT-branch-00-man-03)
- Added /vis/set/maxEventQueueSize.
  If, during a multithreaded run, the simulation gets ahead of the
  visualisation by more than this maximum, the simulation is delayed
  until the vis sub-thread has drawn a few more events.  You may
  change this maximum number of events with
  "/vis/set/maxEventQueueSize <N>”, where N is the
  maximum number you wish to allow.  N <= 0 means "unlimited".
  To avoid visualisation altogether: “/vis/disable”.

1st November 2014  John Allison  (vis-MT-branch-00-man-01)
- Tidied.

1st November 2014  John Allison  (vis-MT-branch-00-man-00)

  o Adds a dummy model with given extent to the current scene.
    This can be used to provide an extent to the scene even if
    no other models with extent are available. For example,
    even if there is no geometry.

    if endOfRunAction is "accumulate".
  o Small bug fix for MT mode:
    . fTransientsDrawnThisEvent should be reset for every event.

22nd November 2013  John Allison (visman-V09-06-27)
- G4VisManager.cc: Fix for end-of-run action "accumulate".
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Tidied.

21st November 2013  Makoto Asai (visman-V09-06-26)

  o /vis/touchable/set/colour and several other commands:
    . Parameter guidance may be called only once. So instances of
      multiple calls to parameter guidance have been eliminated.
      Any extended information that was in parameter guidance has
      been moved to command guidance. This fixes a problem whereby
      guidance information was being lost and fixes a crash in the
      GAG interface.

14th October 2013 Laurent Garnier
  G4VisExecutive.icc: avoid mix with WT driver and GL2PS

    . Implemented maxNumberOfKeptEvents.
  o Cosmetics.

20th September 2013  John Allison  (visman-V09-06-15)
- First implementation of multithreading visualisation:
  o Drawing from user code is explicitly ignored.
  o Events are kept until end of run, then drawn:
    - this could mean a huge consumption of memory.
    - to avoid this, "/vis/disable".
  o Some debug statements remain for testing.

19th September 2013  Makoto Asai  (visman-V09-06-14)
- Implementing IgnoreStateChanges() to be invoked from RayTracer and
  other utilities that have their own event loop.

12th September 2013  Makoto Asai  (visman-V09-06-13)
- Introducing G4VisManager::SetUpForAThread(). This method is invoked
  by G4WorkerRunManager so that G4VisManager will get noticed at the
  end of event of each worker thread.

26th August 2013  John Allison  (visman-V09-06-12)
- /vis/scene/add/magneticField

    elimination of i_mode.  Fixes Bug 1499 (whereby
    trajectory->DrawTrajectory() had stopped working).

10th June 2013  John Allison  (visman-V09-06-07)
- G4ViewParameters.cc: Migrated to modeling-V09-06-06:
  o Replaced PVNameCopyNoPathNotEqual by appropriate operator!=.
  o Replaced VAMSNotEqual by appropriate operator!=.

10th June 2013  John Allison  (visman-V09-06-06)
- G4VViewer:
  o Added new virtual function:
    virtual const std::vector<G4ModelingParameters::VisAttributesModifier>*
    GetPrivateVisAttributesModifiers() const;
    // So that privately accumulated vis attributes modifiers may be
    // concatenated with the standard vis attributes modifiers for commands
    // such as /vis/viewer/set/all and /vis/viewer/save.
    This returns zero by default, but if implemented in a subclass can be
    used to return vis attribute modifiers - e.g., see G4OpenGLQtViewer.
- /vis/viewer/save, /vis/viewer/set/all:
  o Temporarily concatenate the above private vis attribute modifiers for
    saving to standard output or file or copying to a viewer.  Does not
    modify the standard vis attribute modifiers of the current view.
- G4ViewParameters::TouchableCommands:
  o Improve writing of touchable commands for /vis/viewer/save.  If
    successive paths are equal, avoid repeating /vis/set/touchable.

3rd June 2012  John Allison  (visman-V09-05-19)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc/hh, G4VisCommandsGeometrySet.cc:
  o Coverity fixes.

23rd May 2012  John Allison  (visman-V09-05-18)
- Health Check 2012:
  o Over the years we have added drivers and features and added fixes.
    A health check revealed several instances of code duplication,
    unnecessary screen refeshing, incorrect buffer switching
    (necessitating extra refreshing), etc.  This tag is an attempt to
    bring the basic vis algorithms up to full health and efficiency.
  o G4VSceneHandler:
    . ClearStore and ClearTransientStore become "ordinary" virtual
      functions *not* requiring to be called by sub-class
      implementations.  The default implementation in G4VSceneHandler
      is an empty function.
    . ProcessScene:
      - Changed from a private function (called only by friend
        G4VViewer::ProcessView) to a straightforward protected virtual
        function that can be overloaded by the subclass.  A typical
        example of overloading is by
        G4OpenGLScenehandler::ProcessScene, which simply invokes the
        base class function twice, as is required for a good treatment
        of transparency, e.g.,
          void G4OpenGLSceneHandler::ProcessScene()
          {
            G4VSceneHandler::ProcessScene();
            // Repeat if required...
            if (fSecondPassRequested) {
              fSecondPass = true;
              G4VSceneHandler::ProcessScene();
              fSecondPass = false;
              fSecondPassRequested = false;
            }
          }
      - Now assumes graphics database store has already been cleared,
        i.e., ClearStore has been called.  ClearStore is now called
        from G4VViewer::ProcessView just before calling ProcessScene.
      - Existing call to ClearStore removed.
      - Second pass of run-duration models removed (in accordance with
        above change from private to protected virtual function).
      - Call to FinishView removed - this is the repsonsibility of the
        viewer.
  o G4VViewer::ProcessView: ClearStore before ProcessScene.
  o G4VisCommandsScene.cc:
    . /vis/scene/notifyHandlers:
      - Remove a superfluous call to
        ClearTransientStore and associated tentative comments.

22nd April 2012  John Allison  (visman-V09-05-17)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd: Fixed compiler warnings.

12th April 2012  John Allison
- G4VSceneHandler::ProcessScene: Moved FinishView to end.
- G4VisCommandsScene.cc:
  o The above is a fix of the "curious problem" in visman-V09-05-16.
  o Code reverted.
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd: /vis/scene/add/date:
  o G4Timer fTimer instantiated in constructor - more efficient.

- G4VSceneHandler.cc:
  o Augmented drawing loops to take account of model activation state.
- G4Scene.cc:
  o Improved CalculateExtent to take account of model activation state.
  o Tidied operator<<.
- G4VisCommandsScene.cc:
  o /vis/scene/notifyHandlers:
    . Instead of Set+Clear+DrawView, used ApplyCommand("/vis/viewer/refresh")
      twice!!  This was an attempt to fix a curious problem whereby
      trajectories were not refreshed.  Probably the go only to the
      back buffer, because a second refresh seems to do the trick.
  o /vis/scene/list: Improved. 
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: /vis/scene/add/userAction:
  o Small improvement to guidance and code readability.

10th April 2012  John Allison

- G4VisManager::RegisterRunDuration/EndOfEvent/EndOfRunUserVisAction.
  Now you can register any number of named vis actions and associate
  them with particular types of action.  They are added to the scene
  with /vis/scene/add/userAction [<name>] (default all).

8th April 2012  John Allison  (visman-V09-05-13)
- Added /vis/viewer/copyViewFrom.
- G4VisManager.hh: Tidy.
- G4VisCommandsSceneAddUserAction: Tidy model name.

8th April 2012  John Allison  (visman-V09-05-12)
- Added /vis/set/colour and /vis/set/lineWidth.  (/vis/set/ commands
  set "current quantities" for future /vis/scene/add/ commands.)
- /vis/scene/add/frame: Modified to use the above "current quantities".

5th April 2012  John Allison
- G4Scene::CalculateExtent: Include validation of models.  This
  re-calculated extent.  Solves problem of change of extent if a
  volume chnages visibility, for example, by a /vis/geometry command.
- /vis/scene/notifyHandlers:
  o Fix warning message if no scene exists.
  o Call G4Scene::CalculateExtent to ensure extent is up to date.

- Added /vis/set/textLayout and tidied.
- Modified list of "current quantities" for vis commands.
  From G4VVisCommands.hh:
  // Current quantities for use in appropriate commands
  static G4Colour                   fCurrentColour;
  static G4Colour                   fCurrentTextColour;
  static G4Text::Layout             fCurrentTextLayout;
  static G4double                   fCurrentLineThickness;
  static G4VisAttributes::LineStyle fCurrentLineStyle;
  static G4VMarker::FillStyle       fCurrentFillStyle;
  static G4VMarker::SizeType        fCurrentSizeType;
  The default values are (from G4VVisCommands.cc):
  G4VVisCommand::fCurrentColour = G4Colour::White();
  G4VVisCommand::fCurrentTextColour = G4Colour::Blue();
  G4VVisCommand::fCurrentTextLayout = G4Text::left;
  G4VVisCommand::fCurrentLineThickness = 1.;
  G4VVisCommand::fCurrentLineStyle = G4VisAttributes::unbroken;
  G4VVisCommand::fCurrentFillStyle = G4VMarker::filled;
  G4VVisCommand::fCurrentSizeType = G4VMarker::screen;

21st March 2012  John Allison  (visman-V09-05-08)
- Introduced concept of "current quantities" for use in vis commands.
- Added /vis/set/textColour, the first command in the series that

  o Moved /vis/default/ to /vis/viewer/default/ (it is specific to viewers).
- Files removed:
  o G4VisCommandsDefault.hh/cc

- Tagged.

3rd January 2012 Laurent Garnier
- G4VSceneHandler : Add ProcessText method in order to draw text

3rd January 2012  John Allison (visman-V09-05-01)
- G4VisCommandsScene.cc: /vis/scene/notifyHandlers:
  o Downgraded "scene has changed" from WARNING to NOTE. 

2nd January 2012  John Allison
- G4VisManager::EndOfEvent: Removed unwarranted DrawView.  It was
  causing two copies of the geometry to be drawn.

30th December 2011  John Allison  (visman-V09-05-00)
- G4VisManager: Implemented Begin/EndDraw(2D).
  o Note that this forces all thus-bracketed Draw messages to have the
    same transformation.  If an attempt to change the transformation
    is detected, a fatal exception is raised.
- G4VSceneHandler: Added Get/SetObjectTransformation.

12th December 2011  John Allison
- G4VSceneHandler::GetMarkerSize: Bug fix:
  o Bug: If size < 1., size = 1. for all markers.
  o Fix: Applies only to "screen-size" markers.
- G4VisCommandSceneAddLogo: Improvements to /vis/scene/add/logo:
  o In "auto" mode, logo is placed front-bottom-right facing the viewer
    regardless of currenrt viewpoint direction.  (Many examples set the
    viewpoint direction to (-1,0,0) so that the y-axis is up and the
    z-axis horizontal; the beam is usually fired down the z-axis.  This
    improvement puts the G4 logo in a sensible place.)
  o More choices for facing direction:
    . auto|[-]x|[-]y|[-]z - defaults to auto
    . If automatic, faces the user.

12th November 2011  John Allison  (visman-V09-04-12)
- G4VisListManager<T>::SetCurrent:
  o Changed "Fatal" to "JustWarning" for non-existent model.

- G4VisCommands.cc:
  o /vis/list prints available colours.

30th October 2011  John Allison  (visman-V09-04-07)
- G4VisManager:
  o Added Get/SetDefaultViewParameters.
  o These are used by viewers during instantiation.
  o This allows you to set defaults for future operations.
  o You can do this in code or by commands.  In code, e.g., where you
    instantiate the vis manager:
      G4VisManager* visManager = new G4VisExecutive;
      // You can change the default view parameters, i.e., those used on
      // instantiation of a viewer.  First instantiate a view parameters
      // object with default values (e.g., it would draw in wireframe mode).
      G4ViewParameters vp;
      // Change drawing style to "Draw surfaces - hidden surfaces removed".
      vp.SetDrawingStyle(G4ViewParameters::hsr);
      // Make this default for all new viewers.
      visManager->SetDefaultViewParameters(vp);
      visManager->Initialize();
- G4VisCommandsDefault:
  o Added /vis/default/hiddenEdge and /vis/default/style.
  o Sets defaults for future viewers.

  (/vis/scene/add/trajectories) print attributes even if warnings
  are suppressed.
- Migrated to new G4Exception.

21st and 30th June 2011  John Allison
- Added /vis/viewer/set/rotationStyle
  Guidance :

- G4VisCommandsGeometrySet.hh: Added virtual destructors to fix
  compilation warnings.
- G4VisCommandsGeometrySet.cc: Changed "/vis/viewer/rebuild" to
  "/vis/scene/notifyHandlers", the command to be executed after a
  "/vis/geometry/..." command.  "/vis/scene/notifyHandlers" causes
  rebuild if viewer is "auto-refresh", otherwiae a message advises a

26th May 2010  John Allison  (visman-V09-03-02)
- G4VisExecutive.icc: Added drivers with generic nicknames:
  o OGL, OGLI, OGLS, OI.
  o The specific driver depends on G4VIS_USE and G4UI_USE flags.  So,
    for example, "/vis/open OGL" might open an OGLSX window on X or an
    OGLSWin32 on Windows.  It means that example vis.mac scripts can
    be written with this generic command that will work on all systems
    and all user choices.  In particular, it will open an OGLSQt
    window in a G4UIQt session.

- Minor improvements:
  o G4VisManager: Removed event count (not used).
  o G4VSceneHandler: Inhibited drawing when vis disabled.
  o Various /vis/scene commands: Added update statement so that
    handlers are notified after change of scene.  Forces rebuild and
    refresh of all viewers using current scene.

12th November 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-01-08-06)
- Further iteration of event refreshing:
  o G4VisManager:

- /vis/drawVolume and /vis/specify: Suppress all but first warning about
  needing to refresh for viewers that are not auto refresh.
- G4VScenehandler.cc: Remove warning about emepty scene.  (Subsequent action
  is to add a world, if empty - reasonable behaviour.)

5th November 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-01-08-01)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Improved implementation of parallel worlds.  Gets
  material world = *(transportationManager->GetWorldsIterator()) in all cases

- G4VViewer: Removed fModified.  It was used to flag a change of view
  parameters but it was only ever used negatively, i.e., to *prevent*
  its effect of invoking SetView.  So it has been removed and the
  responsibility for calling SetView after a change of view parameters
  rests with the user (e.g., the vis commands).  Only used by OpenGL
  and OpenInventor; now works with opengl-V08-00-01 and
  openinventor-V08-00-00.
- G4VSceneHandler.hh: Improved comments.
- G4VisListManager.hh: Prevent crash on attempt to Print when nothing
  registered.
- G4VisManager.hh: Extended friendship to G4XXXSceneHandler.

25th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-03)
- Retro tag: visman-V08-00-00 + friend status for Ray Tracer.

11th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-02)
- G4VisExecutive.icc: protected with G4VISEXECUTIVE_ICC.
- G4VisManager.hh: prepared for RayTracer reorganisation (friend status).
- G4VisCommandsScene.cc: /vis/scene/create: simplified registration of
  scene to avoid recursive invocation of /vis/scene/notifyHandlers/.
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Improved message when world not available.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: /vis/viewer/refresh: When world added, delegate
  to /vis/scene/notifyHandlers.  Avoids double refresh.
- G4VisManager.cc: Changed ERROR to WARNING when user calls Draw with
  invalid view.

9th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-01)
- This tag includes all the changes below.

9th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-00)
- This tag is geant4-08-00-ref-00 + change of 5th January only.

5th January 2006  John Allison
- G4VSceneHandler.cc: Reversed change of 22nd November 2005:
  fMarkForClearingTransientStore(true) initially now.  This is so that
  at end of event or run, the view is refreshed and the scene
  (detector geometry, etc.) is drawn or written to file.

14th December 2005  John Allison
- Improved /vis/scene/notifyHandlers so that it forces a rebuild of the
  graphical database, if any.  Particularly relevant for Open Inventor.
- G4Scene.cc, G4VSceneHandler.cc: Improved warning messages.
- G4VisManager.cc: Apply "/vis/scene/notifyHandlers" if world has been added
  to an empty scene.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: "/vis/viewer/refresh": if world is added to
  an empty scene, invoke UpdateVisManagerScene, which applies
  "/vis/scene/notifyHandlers", which now forces a rebuild.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: Fix bug in "/vis/viewer/rebuild".

4th December  John Allison (visman-V07-01-10)
- G4Vismanager.cc: Prevent ERROR messages at end of event and run when
  user has not instantiated a scene handler, e.g., in batch mode.

29th November 2005  Jane Tinslay
- Make G4VisManager::RegisterModelFactories() non-pure for 
  backwards compatibility.
- Add information message to G4VisManager::DispatchToModel when default trajectory
  model is used.

23rd November 2005  Joseph Perl  (visman-V07-01-09)

- Get standard colours with "/vis/viewer/set/background red", for example.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: Fixed G4ThreeVector/G4Vector3D problem with
  CLHEP-1.9.2.1.

13th October 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-05)
- Background colour - /vis/viewer/set/background.
- Non-uniform scaling - /vis/viewer/scale and scaleTo.
- Migrated to <sstream>.

12th October 2005  John Allison (vis-V07-01-03)
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: Trapped zero viewer pointer in /vis/viewer/update
  (bug found by system test of vis-V07-01-02).

16th September 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-04)
- Simplified use of ConcreteInstance.  It is now always non-zero for
  an instantiated vis manager; invalid views are reported by the vis
  manager.  The exception is /vis/disable which zeros it; /vis/enable
  or any valid command resets it.

16th September 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-03)
- Issue "/tracking/storeTrajectory 1" on /vis/scene/add/trajectories.
