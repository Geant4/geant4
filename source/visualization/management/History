  managers).

  Warning of scene change issued for other viewers.

15th November 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-01-11)

14th November 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-01-10)
- Merged visman-V08-01-08-branch onto main branch.

14th November 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-01-08-08)
- Partial implementation of /vis/reviewKeptEvents.

14th November 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-01-08-07)
- Minor improvements:
  o G4VisManager: Removed event count (not used).
  o G4VSceneHandler: Inhibited drawing when vis disabled.
  o Various /vis/scene commands: Added update statement so that
    handlers are notified after change of scene.  Forces rebuild and
    refresh of all viewers using current scene.

12th November 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-01-08-06)
- Further iteration of event refreshing:
  o G4VisManager:
    ~ Introduced DrawEvent private method for vis manager and G4VSceneHandler.
    ~ Removed unused methods from previous attempts.

    events.

11th November 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-01-08-05)
- Removed /vis/scene/transientsAction.  Now event keeping by the vis
  manager is automatic if there is a valid scene.  If the user issues
  "/vis/scene/endOfEventAction accumulate [<N>]", events are kept up
  to a maximum N in number (N<0 means unlimited, the default value is
  100).  Otherwise just the last event is kept.

- Merged visman-V08-01-09.

6th November 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-01-09)
- /vis/drawVolume and /vis/specify: Suppress all but first warning about
  needing to refresh for viewers that are not auto refresh.
- G4VScenehandler.cc: Remove warning about emepty scene.  (Subsequent action
  is to add a world, if empty - reasonable behaviour.)

5th November 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-01-08-01)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Improved implementation of parallel worlds.  Gets
  material world = *(transportationManager->GetWorldsIterator()) in all cases
  following fixes run-V08-01-ref04-01 and geomnav-V08-01-ref04-01.

3rd November 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-01-08-00)
- On visman-V08-01-08-branch.
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: First implementation of parallel worlds
  visualisation: /vis/scene/add/volume worlds

- Activated /vis/scene/add/trajectories with "rich" and "smooth" - see below.
  Needs tracking-V08-01-05.

1st November 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-01-07)
- /vis/scene/add/trajectories:
  o Allow string parameters "rich" and "smooth".  Not yet activated
    (awaiting tags in tracking).
  o Deprecate use of integer parameter (i_mode).
- GNUmakefile: Add geometry/magneticfield/include (for new
  /vis/scene/add/trajectories command above).

  (only box -box *box at present).
- G4VSceneHandler:
  o Added GetLineWidth to take account of GlobalLineWidthScale.
  o Added CreateSection/CutawayPolyhedron to exploit generic sectioning
    (DCUT) and cutaways.  Currently not activated due to instabilities in
    BooleanProcessor.
- G4ViewParameters:
  o Added GlobalLineWidthScale.
  o Removed IsViewGeom/Hits/Digis (functionality available in G4Scene).

14th August 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-01-02)
- G4VisManager.hh: Added some OpenGL friends.
- G4VisCommandsCompound.cc: /vis/drawVolume: re-ordered "attach"
  before "add/volume".  Catches non-existing handlers better.  Overall

- G4Scene.cc: Changed default fRecomputeTransients to false.
- G4VisCommandsViewerSet.cc: /vis/viewer/set/style - remove candidates.
  Use first letter only (so "/vis/viewer/set/style wire" works, for example.)
- G4VisFilter/List/ModelManager.hh: Indent printing of models.

22nd May 2006 John Allison  (visman-V08-00-18)

- /vis/.../list commands: Default verbosity "warnings".

13th May 2006 John Allison  (visman-V08-00-17)
- Provided identity transformation for 2D drawing.  A temporary
  expedient until all drivers can implement 2D drawing.

12th May 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-16)
- Added /vis/list.
- Added /vis/scene/add/eventID.
- Final refinements for event/run reprocessing (re-computation of
  transients):
  o Pick up random number status from run manager.
  o Run and event numbers reset.
  o Protect against non-instantiation of run manager.

  /vis/scene/endOfRunAction.  Error for accumulate if end of event
  action is not also accumulate.
- G4VisManager: To get good refresh bahaviour when re-computing
  transients in OpenGL*Xm and similar drivers, postpone ShowView to
  end of run for last event in a run.  This ensures G4 is in Idle
  state.
- GNUmakefile: Added includes for access to run manager for above.

6th March 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-08)
- Added /vis/scene/transientsAction, a feature for recomputing
  transients (trajectories, hits, user drawing, etc.) when needed by
  the viewer.  Thus, transients are "remembered" and may be copied
  between graphics systems.

9th February 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-07)
- First implementation of refresh end-of-event models (trajectories, etc.).

8th February 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-06)

- Very minor printing and comments improvements.

26th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-04)
- G4VViewer: Removed fModified.  It was used to flag a change of view
  parameters but it was only ever used negatively, i.e., to *prevent*
  its effect of invoking SetView.  So it has been removed and the
  responsibility for calling SetView after a change of view parameters
  rests with the user (e.g., the vis commands).  Only used by OpenGL
  and OpenInventor; now works with opengl-V08-00-01 and
  openinventor-V08-00-00.
- G4VSceneHandler.hh: Improved comments.
- G4VisListManager.hh: Prevent crash on attempt to Print when nothing
  registered.

11th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-02)
- G4VisExecutive.icc: protected with G4VISEXECUTIVE_ICC.
- G4VisManager.hh: prepared for RayTracer reorganisation (friend status).
- G4VisCommandsScene.cc: /vis/scene/create: simplified registration of
  scene to avoid recursive invocation of /vis/scene/notifyHandlers/.
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Improved message when world not available.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: /vis/viewer/refresh: When world added, delegate
  to /vis/scene/notifyHandlers.  Avoids double refresh.
- G4VisManager.cc: Changed ERROR to WARNING when user calls Draw with
  invalid view.

9th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-01)
- This tag includes all the changes below.

9th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-00)
- This tag is geant4-08-00-ref-00 + change of 5th January only.

5th January 2006  John Allison
- G4VSceneHandler.cc: Reversed change of 22nd November 2005:
  fMarkForClearingTransientStore(true) initially now.  This is so that
  at end of event or run, the view is refreshed and the scene
  (detector geometry, etc.) is drawn or written to file.

14th December 2005  John Allison
- Improved /vis/scene/notifyHandlers so that it forces a rebuild of the
  graphical database, if any.  Particularly relevant for Open Inventor.
- G4Scene.cc, G4VSceneHandler.cc: Improved warning messages.
- G4VisManager.cc: Apply "/vis/scene/notifyHandlers" if world has been added
  to an empty scene.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: "/vis/viewer/refresh": if world is added to
  an empty scene, invoke UpdateVisManagerScene, which applies
  "/vis/scene/notifyHandlers", which now forces a rebuild.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: Fix bug in "/vis/viewer/rebuild".

4th December  John Allison (visman-V07-01-10)
- G4Vismanager.cc: Prevent ERROR messages at end of event and run when
  user has not instantiated a scene handler, e.g., in batch mode.

29th November 2005  Jane Tinslay
- Make G4VisManager::RegisterModelFactories() non-pure for 
  backwards compatibility.
- Add information message to G4VisManager::DispatchToModel when default trajectory
  model is used.

    G4int i_mode).
  o Created /vis/modeling/trajectories/ for trajectory model messengers.
