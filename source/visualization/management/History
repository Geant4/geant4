14th December 2010  Gabriele Cosmo  (visman-V09-03-16)
- G4VisManager: moved GetVerbosity() static method to non-inline to allow for
  Windows DLL exporting.

13th November 2010  John Allison  (visman-V09-03-15)
- G4VisCommandScene.cc:
  o Backed out change in /vis/scene/notifyHandlers.
  o Improved comments.
- G4VisManager.hh: Tidied layout.

10th November 2010  Laurent Garnier
- G4VisCommandScene.cc:
  o In /vis/scene/notifyHandlers: Add a clear for Transient Store.

- G4VisExecutive.icc: Inlined constructor.
- G4VisManager.cc: Fixed Coverity warning.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: Fixed Coverity warning.

6th November 2010  John Allison
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Fixed Coverity warning.

5th November 2010  John Allison  (visman-V09-03-13)
- G4VSceneHandler.cc and G4ViewParameters.cc:
  o Fixed Coverity warning.

6th October 2010  John Allison  (visman-V09-03-12)
- Added /vis/viewer/set/defaultColour and /vis/viewer/set/defaultTextColour.

3rd September 2010  Gabriele Cosmo  (visman-V09-03-11)
- Added missing inclusion of <sstream> header in G4ViewParameters.cc.

15th June 2010  John Allison  (visman-V09-03-10)
- G4VisCommandsGeometrySet.hh: Added virtual destructors to fix
  compilation warnings.
- G4VisCommandsGeometrySet.cc: Changed "/vis/viewer/rebuild" to
  "/vis/scene/notifyHandlers", the command to be executed after a
  "/vis/geometry/..." command.  "/vis/scene/notifyHandlers" causes
  rebuild if viewer is "auto-refresh", otherwiae a message advises a
  rebuild.  This prevents over-enthusiatic rebuildin.

3rd June 2010  John Allison  (visman-V09-03-09)
- G4VisManager.cc: Checked valid view in DispatchToModel.
- Changed /vis/scene/add/digiti[sz]ations to /vis/scene/add/digis.

1st June 2010  John Allison  (visman-V09-03-07)
- G4VisManager:
  o Made fVerbosity and GetVerbosity static (saves having to get vis
    manager pointer).
  o Some tidying.

- Co-works greps-V09-03-01 and tracking-V09-03-03.
- G4VisManager:
  o Introduced DispatchToModel without i_mode.
  o Moved i-mode deprecation warning to G4VTrajectory.
- G4VSceneHandler.cc:
  o Moved i-mode deprecation warning to G4VTrajectory.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: /vis/viewer/rebuild:
  o Added sceneHandler->ClearTransientStore().

  Introduced optional verbosity string argument in constructor.  You
  can now write, for example:
    G4VisManager* visManager = new G4VisExecutive("quiet");
  Note that the default is "warnings":
    G4VisManager* visManager = new G4VisExecutive;

28th May 2010  John Allison  (visman-V09-03-03)
- Co-works interfaces-V09-03-04.
- G4VisExecutive.icc: Change order of flags to follow G4UIExecutive.

26th May 2010  John Allison  (visman-V09-03-02)
- G4VisExecutive.icc: Added drivers with generic nicknames:
  o OGL, OGLI, OGLS, OI.
  o The specific driver depends on G4VIS_USE and G4UI_USE flags.  So,
    for example, "/vis/open OGL" might open an OGLSX window on X or an
    OGLSWin32 on Windows.  It means that example vis.mac scripts can
    be written with this generic command that will work on all systems
    and all user choices.  In particular, it will open an OGLSQt
    window in a G4UIQt session.

20th May 2010  John Allison  (visman-V09-03-01)
- G4VisCommandsCompound.cc: Restore previous viewer after /vis/drawTree.

    refresh of all viewers using current scene.

12th November 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-01-08-06)
- Further iteration of event refreshing:
  o G4VisManager:

- /vis/drawVolume and /vis/specify: Suppress all but first warning about
  needing to refresh for viewers that are not auto refresh.
- G4VScenehandler.cc: Remove warning about emepty scene.  (Subsequent action
  is to add a world, if empty - reasonable behaviour.)

5th November 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-01-08-01)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Improved implementation of parallel worlds.  Gets
  material world = *(transportationManager->GetWorldsIterator()) in all cases

- /vis/.../list commands: Default verbosity "warnings".

13th May 2006 John Allison  (visman-V08-00-17)
- Provided identity transformation for 2D drawing.  A temporary
  expedient until all drivers can implement 2D drawing.

12th May 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-16)
- Added /vis/list.
- Added /vis/scene/add/eventID.
- Final refinements for event/run reprocessing (re-computation of
  transients):
  o Pick up random number status from run manager.
  o Run and event numbers reset.
  o Protect against non-instantiation of run manager.
- Followed G4CallbackModel change (see modeling-V08-00-09).
- G4VisCommandsScene.cc, G4VisCommandsSceneHandler.cc, G4VisCommandsViewer.cc:
  Corrected SetDefaultValue for verbosity string parameter (changed 0 to "0").

4th May 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-15)
- Improved protection for null models and parameters.

2nd May 2006 Jane Tinslay 
- Add G4TrajectoryGenericDrawerFactory to G4VisExecutive
- Add FilterTrajectory method to G4VisManager

28th April 2006  John Allison (visman-V08-00-14)
- G4VSceneHandler.cc: Added call to FinishView after run-duration
  model computation and before end-of-event and transients
  re-computation to get good buffer swapping behaviour for double
  buffer drivers.
- G4VisCommandsScene.cc: Added protection in
  /vis/scene/endOfRunAction.  Error for accumulate if end of event
  action is not also accumulate.
- G4VisManager: To get good refresh bahaviour when re-computing
  transients in OpenGL*Xm and similar drivers, postpone ShowView to
  end of run for last event in a run.  This ensures G4 is in Idle
  state.
- GNUmakefile: Added includes for access to run manager for above.

22nd April 2006  John Allison (visman-V08-00-13)
- Bug fix (workaround) for memory leak in CheckModel (bug #861).

19th April 2006  John Allison (visman-V08-00-12 - needs greps-V08-00-02)
- G4VisManager:
  o Implemented Draw2D(const G4Text&).
  o Added PrintAvailableModels (but awaiting implementation).
  o Fixed directory names (trailing '/').
- G4VSceneHandler:
  o Implemented Begin/EndPrimitives2D.
  o Migrated to direct access to G4PhysicalVolumeModel.

28th March 2006 Jane Tinslay (jst28032006)
- Introduce G4VisFilterManager.hh to manager filtering
- Additions to G4VisCommandsListManager, G4VisExecutive, G4VisManager
  to support filtering

28th March 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-11)
- Corrects logic of transients re-computation:

- Add G4TrajectoryDrawByOriginVolumeFactory to G4VisExecutive

13th March 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-10)
- Fixes recomputation of transients when changing drivers.

- G4VSceneHandler:
  o Removed fTransientsDrawn (now in G4VisManager).
  o Added fProcessingSolid.
  o Fixed recomputation of transients.

8th March 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-09)
- G4VisManager.cc: Fix bug that causes crash when no current scene handler.

6th March 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-08)
- Added /vis/scene/transientsAction, a feature for recomputing
  transients (trajectories, hits, user drawing, etc.) when needed by
  the viewer.  Thus, transients are "remembered" and may be copied
  between graphics systems.

9th February 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-07)
- First implementation of refresh end-of-event models (trajectories, etc.).

8th February 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-06)
- Needs modeling-V08-00-02.
- G4VSceneHandler.cc: Made use of G4ModelingParameters::DrawingStyle.
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Removed unnecessary #include.

3rd February 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-05)
- Introduced /vis/geometry/... for editing vis attributes of geometry volumes.
- Very minor printing and comments improvements.

26th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-04)
- G4VViewer: Removed fModified.  It was used to flag a change of view
  parameters but it was only ever used negatively, i.e., to *prevent*
  its effect of invoking SetView.  So it has been removed and the
  responsibility for calling SetView after a change of view parameters
  rests with the user (e.g., the vis commands).  Only used by OpenGL
  and OpenInventor; now works with opengl-V08-00-01 and
  openinventor-V08-00-00.
- G4VSceneHandler.hh: Improved comments.
- G4VisListManager.hh: Prevent crash on attempt to Print when nothing
  registered.
- G4VisManager.hh: Extended friendship to G4XXXSceneHandler.

25th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-03)
- Retro tag: visman-V08-00-00 + friend status for Ray Tracer.

11th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-02)
- G4VisExecutive.icc: protected with G4VISEXECUTIVE_ICC.
- G4VisManager.hh: prepared for RayTracer reorganisation (friend status).
- G4VisCommandsScene.cc: /vis/scene/create: simplified registration of
  scene to avoid recursive invocation of /vis/scene/notifyHandlers/.
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: Improved message when world not available.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: /vis/viewer/refresh: When world added, delegate
  to /vis/scene/notifyHandlers.  Avoids double refresh.
- G4VisManager.cc: Changed ERROR to WARNING when user calls Draw with
  invalid view.

9th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-01)
- This tag includes all the changes below.

9th January 2006  John Allison  (visman-V08-00-00)
- This tag is geant4-08-00-ref-00 + change of 5th January only.

5th January 2006  John Allison
- G4VSceneHandler.cc: Reversed change of 22nd November 2005:
  fMarkForClearingTransientStore(true) initially now.  This is so that
  at end of event or run, the view is refreshed and the scene
  (detector geometry, etc.) is drawn or written to file.

14th December 2005  John Allison
- Improved /vis/scene/notifyHandlers so that it forces a rebuild of the
  graphical database, if any.  Particularly relevant for Open Inventor.
- G4Scene.cc, G4VSceneHandler.cc: Improved warning messages.
- G4VisManager.cc: Apply "/vis/scene/notifyHandlers" if world has been added
  to an empty scene.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: "/vis/viewer/refresh": if world is added to
  an empty scene, invoke UpdateVisManagerScene, which applies
  "/vis/scene/notifyHandlers", which now forces a rebuild.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: Fix bug in "/vis/viewer/rebuild".

4th December  John Allison (visman-V07-01-10)
- G4Vismanager.cc: Prevent ERROR messages at end of event and run when
  user has not instantiated a scene handler, e.g., in batch mode.

29th November 2005  Jane Tinslay
- Make G4VisManager::RegisterModelFactories() non-pure for 
  backwards compatibility.
- Add information message to G4VisManager::DispatchToModel when default trajectory
  model is used.

- Get standard colours with "/vis/viewer/set/background red", for example.
- G4VisCommandsViewer.cc: Fixed G4ThreeVector/G4Vector3D problem with
  CLHEP-1.9.2.1.

13th October 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-05)
- Background colour - /vis/viewer/set/background.
- Non-uniform scaling - /vis/viewer/scale and scaleTo.
- Migrated to <sstream>.

12th October 2005  John Allison (vis-V07-01-03)

  (bug found by system test of vis-V07-01-02).

16th September 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-04)
- Simplified use of ConcreteInstance.  It is now always non-zero for
  an instantiated vis manager; invalid views are reported by the vis
  manager.  The exception is /vis/disable which zeros it; /vis/enable
  or any valid command resets it.

16th September 2005  John Allison (visman-V07-01-03)
- Issue "/tracking/storeTrajectory 1" on /vis/scene/add/trajectories.
