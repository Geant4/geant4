- visman-V10-02-05:
  o Inhibited use of BeginRun, BeginEvent, EndEvent and EndRun
    when vis is not enabled, for example after /vis/disable.

  into viewer, or issue "/vis/viewer/refresh"

1st November 2015  John Allison
- visman-V10-01-20:
  o Introduced (again!) <chrono> for queue handling in MT mode.

  o Use auto&& (rather than auto or auto&).

30th July 2015  John Allison (vis-V10-01-09)
- visman-V10-01-11:
  o Re-implemented graphics system fallback strategy.  A graphics system may
    have more than one nickname.  This is used for finding a fallback graphics
    systems when, for example, a Qt session is requested but the user has not
    instantiated a Qt session, or when interactive graphics systems are
    prohibited, as in batch mode.  This allows the user to run an application
    that is fully configured with all available graphics systems, even under
    circumstances for which the primary graphics system is inappropriate.  For
    example, it allows one to make a image with these commands in a batch macro:
      /vis/open OGL
      /vis/drawVolume
      /vis/ogl/export
  o Other small changes - see management/History.
- opengl-V10-01-08:
  o Improved graphics system fallback strategy:
    . Implemented IsUISessionCompatible in G4OpenGLQt and G4OpenGLXm.
    . Qt not allowed unless a Qt session has been instantiated.
    . Interactive graphics systems (Qt, Xm) are not allowed in batch.
  o Several Qt developments (Laurent Garnier).

  "/vis/set/maxEventQueueSize <N>", where N is the
  maximum number you wish to allow.  N <= 0 means "unlimited".

  builds Geant4 in multithreaded mode but only instantiates the
  normal run manager.
#ifdef G4MULTITHREADED
  /* There is a static method G4Threading::IsMultithreadedApplication()
   that returns true only if G4MTRunManager is instantiated with MT
   installation. Thus method returns false if G4RunManager base class is
   instantiated even with the MT installation, or of course with sequential
   installation.
   */

- visman-V09-05-43:
  o Implemented the concept of a "fallback" graphics system.  Used only
    Qt at present.  A Qt viewer will only work with a Qt session so if
    for a user instantiates a non-Qt session we wish to avoid instantiating
    a Qt viewer - instantiate, Xm, for example, instead.  (It's OK to
    instantiate a Qt viewer in batch - no window is opened, but one can create
    a scene, change view parameters and "/vis/ogl/printEPS" to get an
    eps file in batch.)
- opengl-V09-05-48:

    full path of the top physical volume (actually the full path of the mother
    of the top physical volume), so that even if a user issues
    "/vis/drawVolume sub-detector", the full path includes the base full path,
    i.e., the full path up to the world volume.
- visman-V09-05-35:
  o G4VisCommandSceneAdd.cc: G4VisCommandSceneAddVolume:
    Pick up found full path from G4PhysicalVolumeSearchScene so that it can
    be passed to G4PhysicalVolumeModel as a base, as described above.
  o G4VSceneHandler: Deprecated NURBS to be removed at next major release.

- visman-V09-05-27:
  o Removed multi-requested parameter guidance.  Collapsed guidance to one
    long string with '\n' for new lines.  (G4UIparameter cannot cope with
    multi-line guidance.)
- opengl-V09-05-31:
  o G4OpenGLSceneHandler and G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler:
    . Protected against null result of dynamic_cast on viewer (shouldn't happen!!).

  o G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler:
    . Moved colour from display list to PO so that a sub-class may
      modify through the new virtual function below.
  o G4OpenGLStoredViewer:
    . Added virtual void DisplayTimePOColourModification
          (G4Colour&, size_t /*currentPOListIndex*/) {}
      so that a sub-class may modify the colur/transparency.  (If the
      transparency is modified the rendering may not be optimal since
      the order of rendering is determined at POList construction time.)

7th February 2012  John Allison  (vis-V09-05-04-2ndbranch-06)
- vis-V09-05-04-2ndbranch-opengl-05:
  o PO/TOList: Changed G4Text* to G4TextPlus*.

4th February 2012  John Allison  (vis-V09-05-04-2ndbranch-05)
- Needs greps-V09-05-04 (G4Text copy constructor).

2nd February 2012  John Allison  (vis-V09-05-04-2ndbranch-04)
- vis-V09-05-04-2ndbranch-opengl-03:
  o Removed glDrawBuffer(GL_FRONT) when no memory for display lists.
  o G4OpenGLStoredViewer.cc:
    . When re-using AddPrimitive, by-pass the stored AddPrimitive to
      avoid making more display lists and other stuff in
      AddPrimitivePreamble, etc.  Use
        static_cast<G4OpenGLSceneHandler&>(fSceneHandler).
          G4OpenGLSceneHandler::AddPrimitive(...).
    . Fixes StoredQt text problem.

1st February 2012  John Allison
- vis-V09-05-04-2ndbranch-opengl-02: G4OpenGLStoredViewer::DrawDisplayLists:
  o Some systems, notably Qt, re-use model->DescribeYourselfTo(sceneHandler)
    but we don't want to create any further display lists, so...
      G4bool tempMFDL = fG4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.fMemoryForDisplayLists;
      fG4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.fMemoryForDisplayLists = false;
  o But text problem has come back!!!

31st January 2012  John Allison  (vis-V09-05-04-2ndbranch-03)
- vis-V09-05-04-2ndbranch-opengl-01:
  o G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer: Removed DrawText.  Fixes stored text problem.

31st January 2012  John Allison  (vis-V09-05-04-2ndbranch-02)
- vis-V09-05-04-2ndbranch-opengl-00:
  o Special case text: skeleton.  Some systems, notabley Qt, process
    text in a special way; it cannot be stored in display lists.  So the
    text model pointer is stored in the PO/TO and processed separately.
    (PO = Persistent object, TO = transient object.)  The nested classes
    G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler::PO and TO keep relevent information,
    e.g., the display list index or, in this case, when relevant, a
    pointer to the G4TextModel.

30th January 2012  John Allison  (vis-V09-05-04-2ndbranch-01)
- VRML-V09-05-00, DAWN-V09-05-00:
  o Fixed Ubuntu warning about ignoring return value of system call.
- vistree-V09-05-00:
  o G4VTreeSceneHandler.hh:
    . Removed empty implementations of Begin/EndPrimitives, so now
      picks up the default (and correct non-empty default
      implementations in G4VSceneHandler).  The problem is that
      objectTransformation must be set to something.  This was causing a
      G4Exception in G4VisManager::DrawT.

13th January 2012  John Allison  (vis-V09-05-05)
- DAWN-V09-05-00, VRML-V09-05-00:
  o Fixed Ubuntu warnings about ignoring return value of system call.
- visman-V09-05-02, opengl-V09-05-02 (Laurent Garnier):
  o Fixes for Qt Stored text.

12th January 2012  John Allison
- vistree-V09-05-00: G4VTreeSceneHandler.hh:
  o Removed empty implementations of Begin/EndPrimitives, so now
    picks up the default (and correct non-empty default
    implementations in G4VSceneHandler).  The problem is that
    objectTransformation must be set to something.  This was causing a
    G4Exception in G4VisManager::DrawT.

3rd January 2012  John Allison  (vis-V09-05-04)
- modeling-V09-05-01: Validates geometry in all worlds.

3rd January 2012  John Allison  (vis-V09-05-03)
- opengl-V09-05-01 and openinventor-V09-05-00:
  o Removed #ifdef G4VIS... protection from header files so that they
    can be used for a possible dynamic library.  Of course, the
    protection remains on the implementation files.

3rd January 2012  John Allison  (vis-V09-05-02)
- visman-V09-05-01:
  o /vis/scene/notifyHandlers:
    . Downgraded "scene has changed" from WARNING to NOTE. 
  o G4VisManager::EndOfEvent: Removed unwarranted DrawView.  It was
    causing two copies of the geometry to be drawn.
- visXXX-V09-05-00:
  o Removed #ifdef ...XXXSG... protections.
    . No longer any reliance on imported tree code; own tree code used. 
- opengl-V09-05-00:
  o Corrected treatment of colour for transient objects.
  o G4OpenGLSceneHandler: Significant rationalisation.

30th December 2011  John Allison  (vis-V09-05-01 co-works greps-V09-05-02)
- modeling-V09-05-00: G4TrajectoriesModel::DescribeYourselfTo:
  o Used Begin/EndDraw to improve drawing speed.
    . Assumes all trajectories are drawn with the same transformation.
      If not, a fatal exception with be raised in G4VisManager::DrawT.
  o Changed FatalException to JustWarning in
    G4AttributeFilterT<T>::AddInterval and AddValue.
- visman-V09-05-00:
  o G4VisManager: Implemented Begin/EndDraw(2D).
    . Note that this forces all thus-bracketed Draw messages to have the
      same transformation.  If an attempt to change the transformation
      is detected, a fatal exception is raised.
  o G4VSceneHandler: Added Get/SetObjectTransformation.
  o Marker size bug fix.

- Collected tags below.  Main features since Release 8.0:
  o Added /vis/scene/transientsAction.  The default is "rerun", i.e.,
    when the viewer requests, the previous event or run will be
    processed again with the original random number seed so that
    transients (trajectories, hits, user drawing, etc.) are
    reconstructed.  Thus, transients are "remembered" and may be
    copied between graphics systems.  Turn off with
    "/vis/scene/transientsAction none".
  o Introduced /vis/geometry/... for editing vis attributes of
    geometry volumes.

18th November 2005  Joseph Perl  (vis-V07-01-07)
- Minor modification of geant4-07-01-ref-05 to facilitate acceptance
  of greps-V07-01-09 and tracking tracking-V07-01-02.  As with
  vis-V07-01-06, it should subsequently simply be ignored.

15th November 2005  Guy Barrand
- openinventor-V07-01-03: Background, scaling and window positioning.  Also
  reading and wroting of .iv files.

14th November 2005  John Allison (vis-V07-01-06)
- Minor modification of vis-V07-01-03 + vis-HepRep-V07-01-04 (to avoid
  warnings on Sun), i.e., it excludes all development since then. This
  tag is purely to facilitate acceptance of greps-V07-01-09.  To
  achieve this, the modification was made on a branch -
  vis-V07-01-03-branch - of just one file, namely G4VisManager.hh.
  This should subsequently simply be ignored.

13th November 2005  John Allison

  openinventor-V07-01-02
  visXXX-V07-01-00
  vis-HepRep-V07-01-01

30th September 2005  Joseph Perl (raytracer-V07-01-03)
New tag to include change Makoto made an hour after V07-01-02 was tagged.
Change seems to just involve passing pWorld to material list where no argument was passed in previous version.

  o Fixed default values in /vis/scene/add/text.

12th May 2005  John Allison
- Moved zlib to externals/zlib.

6th May 2005  John Allison  (vis-V07-00-14)
- OpenGL: fixed bug (views not refreshed - opengl-V07-00-02).
- Improved ASSCIITree guidance.
- G4VisExecutive: Replaced printing of available graphics systems.
  Now corresponds to behaviour of most old examples vis managers.
- Fixed some pedantic warnings from gcc 4.

  volumes (modeling-V07-00-00).

5th May 2005  John Allison
- Introduced zlib directory.

22nd April 2005  John Allison
- OpenGL: Implemented text for X-Windows viewers (opengl-V07-00-00/1).

10th April 2005  John Allison  (visman-V07-00-00)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: 2nd attempt to fix access to fpVisManager
  from nested class for SUN.

16th March 2005  John Allison  (vis-V07-00-13)
- G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc: fixed access to fpVisManager from nested class.
- For gcc 2.95.2: Fixed G4String return for viewer commands.
- Added constructor and virtual destructor to G4VUserVisAction.

15th March 2005  John Allison  (vis-V07-00-12)
- Added return type G4int to G4ViewParameters::SetNoOfSides and
  G4ModelingParameters::SetNoOfSides.  They return no. of sides, i.e.,
  sides per circle in polyhedron contruction, that are actually set;
  there is a lower limit of 12.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel: bug fix: no. of rotation steps correctly applied.

10th March 2005  John Allison  (vis-V07-00-11)
- Reviewed all vis commands.  Improved guidance, simplified and
  rationalised the commands.

9th March 2005  John Allison
- Removed "remove" and "edit" commands.
- G4VisManager: removed "Delete" methods. (Removing or deleting an
  existing scene, scene handler or viewer is very messy and not
  necessary.  When a user creates a new one, he/she may leave the old
  one around without harm.  It may be left unused or selected again later
  if the user wants.)
- Removed automatic parameter candidate specification for commands
  that take an argument that is a scene, scene handler or viewer
  name - it is checked in SetNewValue methods.  (The code was just
  too complicated and, anyway, the result hindered, rather than
  helped the user, because it restricted the parameter values and
  mis-typing gave obscure messages.  Now the messages are clearer and,
  as the guidance points out, the list of possible names can be
  obtained with a "list" command.)
- Made "list" commands flag current items.
- Improved guidance for /vis/scene commands.  Still to do (groan!):
    /vis/scene/add
    /vis/sceneHandler
    /vis/viewer

9th March 2005  John Allison  (vis-V07-00-10, needs greps-V07-00-01)
- Refined logo and scale.
- Improved physical volume clipping.
- G4VisManager: Added default G4Transform3D::Identity to
  objectTransformation argument in Draw methods.

4th March 2005  John Allison  (vis-V07-00-09)
- Added first implementation of cutaway - a clipping box for physical
  volume tree:
    vis/scene/add/volume ! ! ! box km 0 1 0 1 0 1
  (Does not seem properly to clip volumes wholly inside clipping volume.)

3rd March 2005  John Allison  (vis-V07-00-08)
- Introduced /vis/scene/add/logo.
- Added Set methods to G4VModel.
- Added argument to G4CallbackModel::operator()(const G4Transform3D&) so that
  the model could implement a given transformation.  Provided default for
  G4VUserVisAction::(const G4Transform3D& = G4Transform3D::Identity).
- Improved guidance for:
    compound commands
    ASCIITree commands
- Used std::istrstream::istrstream(std::string) throughout.

23rd February 2005  John Allison  (vis-V07-00-07)
- Protected scene handlers for the case of the drawing of solids NOT
  from a physical volume tree:
    G4FRSceneFunc.icc
    G4OpenGLSceneHandler.cc
    G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.cc
    G4ASCIITreeSceneHandler.cc
    G4GAGTreeSceneHandler.cc
- Fixed a problem with ClearTransientStore.  ClearTransientStore
  should restrict itself to its job.  In the following files,
  ClearTransientStore also redraws the view.  In other places, a draw
  command often follows, so it is not needed here.  In fact it can
  cause a double recursive descent into DrawView, so the existing code
  has been commented out (JA - 23/Jan/05):
    G4FRSceneFunc.icc
    G4HepRepFileSceneHandler.cc
    G4OpenGLImmediateSceneHandler.cc
    G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.cc
    G4VRML1SceneHandlerFunc.icc
    G4VRML2SceneHandlerFunc.icc
    G4XXXSceneHandler.cc
- Removed (commented out) some code that forced extra kernel visits,
  purportedly to overcome a problem in OpenGLStored methods.  Let's
  fix OpenGL if necessary:
    G4VSceneHandler.cc
    G4VViewer.cc
- Commented out SetView and ClearView in /vis/viewer/refresh:
    G4VisCommandsViewer.cc
- Changed signature of G4VViewer::SetNeedKernelVisit(G4bool) for compatibility.

19th February 2005  John Allison  (vis-V07-00-06 with greps-V07-00-00)
- Added G4VUserVisAction and G4CallbackModel.
- Implemented /vis/scene/add/userAction.
- Fixed bug in /vis/viewer/update (check existence of scene handler and scene).

15th February 2005  John Allison  (vis-V07-00-05)
- Introduced drawing of readout geometry for logical volumes.
- For drawing of logical volumes, introduced boolean flags to control 
  drawing of:
    o boolean components (if any)
    o voxels (if any) (note: voxels are not created until start of run)
    o readout geometry (if any)
- Augmented commands /vis/specify and /vis/scene/add/logicalVolume to use
  above flags.
- G4ASCIITree: Added printing of names of sensitive detector (if any) and
  readout geometry (if any).

15th February 2005  John Allison  (vis-V07-00-04)
- Updated READMEs for G4VisExecutive.  Removed references to OPACS.

9th February 2005  John Allison  (vis-V07-00-03)
- Migration from AddThis to AddSolid and AddCompound: fixed previously
  missed FukuiRendererSceneHander.

4th February 2005  John Allison  (vis-V07-00-02)
- Introduced G4VisExecutive.  MyVisManager deprecated.

27th January 2005  John Allison  (vis-V07-00-01, needs intercoms-V07-00-00)
- Migration from AddThis to AddSolid and AddCompound.
- AddSolid: Methods for adding solids to the scene handler.  They
  must always be called in the triplet PreAddSolid, AddSolid and
  PostAddSolid.  The transformation and visualization attributes
  must be set by the call to PreAddSolid.  A possible default
  implementation is to request the solid to provide a G4Polyhedron
  or similar primitive - see, for example, G4VSceneHandler.
- AddCompound: Methods for adding "compound" GEANT4 objects to the scene
  handler.  These methods may either (a) invoke "user code" that
  uses the "user interface", G4VVisManager (see, for example,
  G4VSceneHandler in the Visualization Category, which for
  trajectories uses G4VTrajectory::DrawTrajectory, via
  G4TrajectoriesModel in the Modeling Category) or (b) invoke
  AddPrimitives below (between calls to Begin/EndPrimitives) or (c)
  use graphics-system-specific code or (d) any combination of the
  above.

26th January 2005  John Allison  (vis-V07-00-00)
- G4VisManager:: removed optional argument
  const G4Transform3D& objectTransformation = G4Transform3D::Identity
  from Draw methods for a hit and trajectory.
- Trapped illegal nesting of Begin/EndPrimitives.
- Added fpCurrentMaterial to G4VSceneHandler and relevant derived
  classes and models for work with G4PhysicalVolumeModel via
  EstablishSpecials.  So now, the material is also available (in addition
  to current depth, logical and physical volum) during drawing of geometry
  items.
- Changed ASCIITree to use G4VSolid::GetCubicVolume and
  G4LogicalVolume::GetMass.
- Changed G4PhysicalVolumeMassScene to use G4VSolid::GetCubicVolume.
- Improved guidance for /vis/viewer/set/hiddenMarker.
- G4VisCommandsViewerSet: made Up and Viewpoint vectors unit for safety.
- Some additions to test area.

10th December 2004 Gabriele Cosmo (vis-V06-02-09)
- Replaced M_PI with CLHEP's pi.

7th December 2004 Joseph Perl (vis-V06-02-08)
- Tagged right after migration to cmath
- All occurences of include <math.h> have now become include <cmath>.
- All math functions are now prefaced with std::

7th December 2004 Joseph Perl (vis-V06-02-07)
- Tagged right before migration to cmath

26th November 2004 Joseph Perl (vis-V06-02-06)
- Tagged for release 7.0.
- Made from vis-V06-02-05
- plus opengl-V06-02-07 by John Allison
- plus vis-HepRep-V06-02-02 by Mark Donszelmann
- plus openinventor-V07-00-00 by Guy Barrand

18th November 2004  John Allison
- Included opengl-V06-02-07.

11th November 2004  John Allison  (vis-V06-02-05)
- Made use of smart method GetPolyhedron for solids.  This greatly
  speeds 2nd and subsequent drawings when kernel access is required.
- Rationalised use of EstablishSpecials: functionality moved to base class.
- Removed use of obsolete G4Polymarker::line.

22nd September 2004  John Allison  (vis-V06-02-04)
- Moved Doxyfile to management.  doxygen output to tmp area.
- modeling-V06-02-01 - small fixes.
- vistree-V06-02-01 - small fixes.
- opengl-V06-02-06 - Trap non-regular polyhedra and other small changes.
- DAWN-V06-02-00 - Improve diagnostic on trapping non-regular polyhedra.
- vistest-V06-02-02: refined rotated tube test.

13th September 2004  John Allison  (vis-V06-02-03)
- vistree-V06-02-00: Improved ASCIITree:
  verbosity >= 3: prints volume, density of all volumes in hierarchy.
  verbosity >= 4: calculates the mass of the complete geometry tree taking
    into account daughters up to the depth specified for each physical
    volume in the current scene.  Culling is ignored so that all volumes
    are processed.  The calculation is quite tricky, since it involves
    subtracting the mass of that part of the mother that is occupied by
    each daughter and then adding the mass of the daughter, and so on
    down the heirarchy.  Uses G4PhysicalVolumeMassScene - see below.
  Added option to write to file (/vis/ASCIITree/set/outFile).
- modeling-V06-02-00: Added G4PhysicalVolumeMassScene and improvements
  to G4PhysicalVolumeModel.  See modeling/History for more details.
- Removed obsolete file: G4VisToOldVisCommands.hh
- Corrected mistake in /vis/viewer/set/*Vector commands.
- Augmented ParameterisedBox and rotated a tracker tube in test directory.
- Brought README.built_in_commands up to date for Geant4 6.2.  Removed all
  references to old commands.'

3rd August 2004  John Allison
- Rationalised vis command code (uses G4UIcommand static conversion
  functions where possible).
- Removed G4ViewParameters::DrawingStyle GetDrawingStyle (const
  G4Visible&).  Instead, developer has to:
    // Get vis attributes - pick up defaults if none.
    const G4VisAttributes* pVA =
      fpViewer -> GetApplicableVisAttributes (v.GetVisAttributes ());
  where v is the visible object (polyline, circle, polyhedron, etc.), and:
    // Get view parameters that the user can force through the vis
    // attributes, thereby over-riding the current view parameter.
    G4ViewParameters::DrawingStyle drawing_style = GetDrawingStyle (pVA);
    G4bool isAuxEdgeVisible = GetAuxEdgeVisible (pVA);
  Most developers do this anyway, so the removed routine was redundant
  and resulting code is more efficient and transparent.  To get
  colour, the developer can pick up directly from the vis attrributes,
  pVA, obtained as above:
    const G4Colour& c = pVA -> GetColour ();
  or use a slightly less efficient method:
    const G4Colour& c = GetColour (v);
  where v is the visible object.
  Note that for text, the developer must use a different procedure,
  since the default text colour is determined by the default text vis
  attributes, which may be specified independent of default vis
  attributes of other types of visible objects.  A function,
  GetTextColour, is provided and the recommended use is:
    const G4Colour& c = GetTextColour (text);  // Picks up default if none.
- Rationalised use of vis attributes in OpenGL and XXX.

28th July 2004  John Allison  (vis-V06-02-02 with greps-V06-02-00)
- Implemented force auxiliary edge visible feature of G4VisAttributes.
- Included openinventor-V06-02-00 (minor revision - Guy Barrand).

23rd July 2004  John Allison
- Added auxiliary edge visible flag to G4ViewParameters and a new
  command, /vis/viewer/set/auxiliaryEdge.  (Auxiliary edges are not
  genuine edges of the volume.  They may be in a curved surface made
  out of polygons, for example, or in plane surface of complicated
  shape that has to be broken down into simpler polygons.
  HepPolyhedron breaks all surfaces into triangles or quadrilaterals.
  There will be auxiliary edges for any volumes with a curved surface,
  such as a tube or a sphere, or a volume resulting from a Boolean
  operation.  Normally, they are not shown, but sometimes it is useful
  to see them.  In particular, a sphere, because it has no egdes, will
  not be seen in wireframe mode in some graphics systems unless this
  flag is turned on.)

16th July 2004  John Allison
- Refined forced wireframe algorithm - *always* force wireframe even
  if hidden line removal is specified.
- opengl-V06-02-04.

15th July 2004  John Allison
- Small improvement to G4XXX (sample graphics system).

14th July 2004  John Allison  (vis-V06-02-01)
- Removed deprecated commands:
    /vis/viewer/show               (use /vis/viewer/update)
    /vis/viewer/lightsThetaPhi     (use /vis/viewer/set/lightsThetaPhi)
    /vis/viewer/lightsVector       (use /vis/viewer/set/lightsVector)
    /vis/viewer/viewpointThetaPhi  (use /vis/viewer/set/viewpointThetaPhi)
    /vis/viewer/viewpointVector    (use /vis/viewer/set/viewpointVector)
  (See geant4/source/visualization/README.built_in_commands for list
  of current commands.)
- Tidied guidance for /vis/viewer/set.
- Included opengl-V06-02-03 (cosmetic).

14th July 2004  John Allison  (vis-V06-02-00)
- opengl-V06-02-02 and vistest-V06-02-01:
  Hidden line *and/or* hidden surface removal now work for OGL*X and OGL*Xm.

1st July 2004  John Allison
- Correction to guidance of /vis/viewer/set/hiddenEdge.
- Small improvement to README of /vis/scene/add/axes.
- vistest-V06-02-00.
- opengl-V06-02-00.
- visman-V06-02-00: Fix for porting on gcc-3.4.0: made ProcessView()
  public, since used as private friend (Gabriele Cosmo).

- Adopt G4DLLIMPORT/G4DLLEXPORT technique to handle extern simbols for
  allowing support of DLLs on Windows.
- Minor correction in modeling/GNUmakefile for GLOBLIBS definition.
- Coworks with "global-V06-01-02b".

7th June 2004  Gabriele Cosmo  (vis-V06-01-02)
- Includes "vis-HepRep-V06-01-04".

- Coworks with "global-V06-01-02a".

9th April 2004  John Allison  (vis-V06-01-01 + interfaces-V06-01-00)
- Tagged OpenGL as below.  Joint with interfaces-V06-01-00.

7th April 2004  Guy Barrand
- visualization/OpenGL/* : use the G4OpenGL.hh file.
- Added : visualization/OpenGL/include/G4OpenGL.hh to encapsulate
  the include of gl/gl.h and gl/glu.h that may be platform dependant.
  It permits to rm some #ifdef WIN32 spread in the code. It opens also

- Improved READMEs.
- Reduced warnings from OpenGL - see OpenGL/History.
- Cosmetic changes to test.
- Added explicit invocation of base class methods to avoid warnings about
  hiding of base class methods.

17th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-12)
- Coworks with greps-V03-02-02 and intercoms-V03-02-04.
- Added G4VisManager::Draw(const G4Scale&,...  Needs intercoms-V03-02-04.
- Added template graphics system XXX.
- Improved verbosity guidance.

14th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-11)
- Coworks with greps-V03-02-02 and intercoms-V03-02-03.
- Moved default value G4Transform3D::Identity of argument from
  G4VSceneHandler::BeginPrimitives to
  G4VGraphicsScene::BeginPrimitives.  Needs intercoms-V03-02-03.
- Fixed bug in G4VSceneHandler::AddPrimitive(const G4Scale&).  Needs
  greps-V03-02-02.
- Added sceneHandler.Begin/EndPrimitives messages to models (long
  standing bug!).
- Removed "dummy" graphics systems in G4VisManager.cc.
- Improved robustness of some commands, particularly
  /vis/scene/notifyHandlers.
- Improved support for multiple viewers (but see OpenGL/History).

11th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-10-01)
- Implemented /vis/scene/endOfEventAction.

9th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-10-00)
- Note: non-standard tag to indicate internal use only.
- Added /vis/scene/create at start of compound command /vis/open to avoid
  warnings.
- Removed G4ModelingParameters::hierarchy.  It is no longer used.  The
  textual or graphical representation of the geometry hierarchy is now
  done in G4xxxTree classes in visua;ization/Tree.
- Removed /vis/scene/notifyHandlers from
  G4VVisCommandScene::UpdateVisManagerScene - too much updating going on.
  It was leading to recursive refreshing/updating.
- Implemented auto-refresh at end of event.  (See also OpenGL/History.)
  Introduced G4VSceneHandler::Get/SetMarkForClearingTransientStore for
  postponed (lazy) clearing of transients (e.g., trajectories) from store
  (graphical database) and view.  The mark is set at the end of
  G4VisManager::EndOfEvent and the actual clearing is done in:
    void G4VisManager::ClearTransientStoreIfMarked(){
      // Assumes valid view.
      if (fpSceneHandler->GetMarkForClearingTransientStore()) {
        fpSceneHandler->SetMarkForClearingTransientStore(false);
        fpSceneHandler->ClearTransientStore();
      }
    }
  which is called at the start of each G4VisManager::Draw and the beginning
  of G4VisManager::EndOfEvent.  Thus the picture stays from the end of all
  drawing for the event until the first drawing of the next event.
    
5th August 2001  John Allison
- Small refinements to printing under new verbosity control.

4th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-10)
- Re-implemented verbosity control.  Output statements wherever possible
  are controlled by the verbosity in a simple graded message scheme:
    enum Verbosity {
      quiet,         // Nothing is printed.
      startup,       // Startup and endup messages are printed...
      errors,        // ...and errors...
      warnings,      // ...and warnings...
      confirmations, // ...and confirming messages...
      parameters,    // ...and parameters of scenes and views...
      all            // ...and everything available.
    };
  Note that the G4VisManager member object name and type have changed:
    Verbosity             fVerbosity;  // New.
    const G4int           fVerbose;
    // fVerbose is kept for backwards compatibility for some user
    // examples.  (It is used in the derived user vis managers to print
    // available graphics systems.)  It is initialised to 1 in the
    // constructor and cannot be changed.

3rd August 2001  John Allison
- Added README.quick, a quick installation guide.

30th July 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-09)
- Eliminated view parameters from G4VisManager.  Now, each view maintains its
  own parameters.  Can be copied from one view to another with:
    /vis/viewer/set/all <from-viewer-name>
    Copies view parameters from from-viewer to current viewer.
    Affects current viewer.
- Removed redundant methods from G4VisManager, mostly to do with old-style
  commands.

27th July 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-08)
- Needs config-V03-02-01.
- Introduced environment variable G4VIS_NONE that, if set, no visualization
  drivers are built and no vis libraries are built, not even
  libG4vis_management.  (libG4modeling is still built.)  The C-pre-processor
  variables G4VIS_BUILD and G4VIS_USE are *not* set.
- Removed the need to specify environment variables for visualization drivers
  which do not need external packages or libraries, namely :
      G4VIS_BUILD_DAWNFILE_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_RAYTRACER_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_VRMLFILE_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_ASCIITREE_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_GAGTREE_DRIVER
    with associated G4VIS_USE environment variables:
      G4VIS_USE_DAWNFILE
      G4VIS_USE_RAYTRACER
      G4VIS_USE_VRMLFILE
      G4VIS_USE_ASCIITREE
      G4VIS_USE_GAGTREE
  For backwards compatibility, unless G4VIS_NONE is set, the corresponding
  C-pre-processor variables are automatically set.  Also, the C-pre-processor
  variables G4VIS_BUILD and G4VIS_USE are set.
- As before, environment variables for other drivers still need positive
  setting of their G4VIS_BUILD and G4VIS_USE environment variables.  In this
  category are:
      G4VIS_BUILD_DAWN_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OPACS_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OPENGLX_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OPENGLWIN32_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OPENGLXM_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OIX_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OIWIN32_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_VRML_DRIVER
    with associated G4VIS_USE environment variables:
      G4VIS_USE_DAWN
      G4VIS_USE_OPACS
      G4VIS_USE_OPENGLX
      G4VIS_USE_OPENGLWIN32

- Changed rotation of phi-replicas in G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc to
  ensure correspondence with rule that phi=0 bisects the replica.
  WARNING: Prior to this fix the graphics did NOT correspond to the
  replica navigation.  If you have been relying on the graphics to
  position daughter volumes in a phi-replica, navigation will have
  been incorrect, possibly without causing a crash.  The above fix
  will change the apparent position as shown by the graphics and you
  will have to correct the positioning of daughters.  Make sure the
  diaghters are all properly enclosed within the replica.  Graphics
  and navigation now correspond,

7th March 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-00-07)
- Cosmetic corrections for ISO compliance.

  being used.  Let's schedule this change for the next version of Geant4.
- Added the following new commands:
  /vis/enable [true|false]
  /vis/disable
  /vis/verbose [<verbosity-integer>]
  /vis/viewer/set/lineSegmentsPerCircle  [<number-of-sides-per-circle>]
  /vis/viewer/set/sectionPlane ...
  Only /vis/scene/add/text and /vis/scene/add/axes to go!!!

4th February 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-00-04)
- /vis/viewer commands no longer update vis manager's view parameters.
- Most /vis~/ copmmands give DEPRECATED warning, except:
  /vis~/draw/axes
  /vis~/draw/text
  /vis~/set/section_plane
  /vis~/set/sides
  /vis~/set/verbose
  which have still to be re-implemented.  All /vis~/ commands are still
  available through /vis/ for the time being.  (Window size hint no longer
   works.)
- Added "auto refresh" to view parameters.
- Added "default" view parameters to viewers.
- Made OpenGL viewers "auto refresh" by default.
- Added:
  /vis/viewer/set/autoRefresh
  /vis/viewer/set/projection
- Added compound command:
  /vis/drawView [<theta-deg>] [<phi-deg>]
                [<pan-right>] [<pan-up>] [<pan-unit>]
                [<zoom-factor>]

  /vis/viewer/set/lightsMove

3rd February 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-00-02)
- Tidied for CodeWizard.  Small changes to many files in management, modeling
  and OpenGL.

1st February 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-00-01)
- Fixed cause of crash when setting viewpoint before creating scene (Bug #157).
  Solution: SetView no longer called when view parameters are changed.  In
  any case it's called just before drawing, whixh is the right place.
- Fixed /vis/set/sides problem (Satoshi Tanaka) (Bug #204).
  Solution: Update view's view parameters in /vis/set/sides - had somehow
  been overlooked.

25th January 2001  John Allison
- Added protection against empty G4Polyhedron objects.
   FukuiRenderer/src/G4FRSceneFunc.icc
   OPACS/src/G4GoSceneHandler.cc
   OpenGL/src/G4OpenGLSceneHandler.cc
   OpenInventor/src/G4OpenInventorSceneHandler.cc
   VRML/src/G4VRML1SceneHandlerFunc.icc
   VRML/src/G4VRML2SceneHandlerFunc.icc

25th January 2001  John Allison  (opengl-V03-00-00)
- Fixed Bug #120.  Implemented running re-calculation of up-vector in
  the case of "object rotation" (lights move with camera) to prevent
  "flipping" of view when camera passes through up-vector.  Note that
  the default is "camera rotation" (lights do not move with camera,
  i.e., remain fixed relative to object) so the default is that this
  "flipping" can happen.  To set "object rotation" (lights move with
  camera) use /vis/lights/move_with_camera true (soon to be
  /vis/viewer/set/lights move-with-camera) or click "Object" radio
  button on Rotation Panel in OpenGLXm mode.
- Changed some objects to references for efficiency.  E.g.:
  const G4Vector3D& vp = pView->fVP.GetViewpointDirection ().unit ();

18th January 2001  John Allison
- Corrected G4PhysicalVolumeModel.  This corrects a bug whereby the
  requested drawing of a physical volume and its decendants starting
  at a depth greater than 2 was incorrectly positioned on the screen.
- /vis/scene/include commands withdrawn - use equivalent commands
  /vis/scene/add.
- OpenGL: cosmetic and minor performance improvements.

16th January 2001  John Allison  (vis-03-00-00)
- All vis commands "available" in all G4 states.
- Other small cosmetic changes to commands.
- OpenGL: square and circle markers correctly rendered.
  Note: subsequent rotations in stored mode also rotate these markers.
- Some small changes to test  - see test/History.

          - Added (long unsigned int) cast in G4OpenGLXmRotationCallbacks.cc.
          - Added SetView and ShowView to G4OpenGLXViewer:

                G4OpenGLViewer::SetView ();  
              }
              // Hopefully to get better flushing in DEC OpenGL...
              void G4OpenGLXViewer::ShowView () {
                glXWaitGL ();
                glFlush ();
              }


vis-01-00-04 11th January 1999  John Allison

- OpenGL - reverted to 100%.

vis-00-04-03  9th December 1998  John Allison
- Made /vis/ commands from /vis~/.  The idea is to maintain backwards
  compatibility while allowing us to "deprecate" the old commands over
  a period of time.  Some of these /vis/ commands respond with "superceded",
  i.e., superceded by new commands, but still available in /vis~/.
- OpenGL viewing volume increased by 20% to prevent corners being clipped.

- 08/12/98 : G.Barrand : OpenInventor : due to 
  huge load problems on various platforms, init only
  the HEPVis things that are needed.

- VRML 2.0 Visualization driver is added to 
  management/include/MyVisManager.cc.

vis-00-03-05  9th November 1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- VRML 2.0 Visualization driver is commited:
 (1) Generatin of VRML 2.0 format files to describe Geant4 simulation.
 (2) Interactive displaying of physiccal-volume names and copy numbers
 (3) Interactive displaying of hit positions (displayed strings are
     costomizable.
 (4) Wireframe drawing style of Geant4 visualization is reflected as
     transparency = 0.7.  This value is customizable.
     If transparency is 1.0, drawing of detector geometry is skipped,
     and hits can be picked easily.

6th November 1998  John Allison
- Implemented basic /vis/viewer commands.
- Added `const G4String& name' argument to G4VScene and G4VView constructors.

vis-00-03-04  30th October 1998  John Allison
- Tagged.

29th October 1998  Guy Barrand
- G4OpenGLXView.hh, G4OpenGLXmView.cc, G4OpenGLXmWindowHandlingCallbacks.cc
  in order that things compile and compile without warnings on HP/aCC

14th October 1998  John Allison
- Augmented the new /vis/ commands.  Still not complete but they
  co-work with the old commands.
- Changed char* fName to G4String fName in G4VScene and G4VView.
  Consequent changes in G4OpenGLView.  Also OpenInventor?  Etc.

11th October 1998 Andy Walkden
- added (not a very good) version of hidden lines removal code. This code 
  suffers from depth buffering artefacts. glPolygonOffset is a feature of 
  OpenGL version 1.1, and can help overcome depth buffer problems. The code 
  to utilise glPolygonOffset is committed, but commented out, as it doesn't 
  seem to work with the version of Mesa available on rsplus currently. My 
  ideal strategy is to enable depth testing, draw the model as lines, enable 
  filled polygon offsetting (glPolygonOffset(1.0 /*offset scale factor*/, 
  2/*offset bias*/); glEnable (GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILLED);) then draw the 
  model as filled polygons. The offsetting should just add `2' (in window 
  coordinates, I think) onto the z value of all vertices relating to filled 
  polygons, thus dismissing the conflict between almost identical z values 
  for lines and filled polygon edges.

vis-00-03-03 9th October 1998  John Allison
- G4VisManager inherits G4VStateDependent.  This is used to draw
  end-of-event models.

4th October 1998 Andy Walkden
- Added ability for all G4OpenGLX derived graphics systems to produce
  vectored PostScript hardcopy. Facility for `automated screen dump'
  (i.e. pixmap output) still kept, as some rasterization features
  don't make it into the vectored PostScript output (such as haloing
  effects). Facility currently available via G4OpenGLXm by clicking
  `Miscellany' then `Create .eps file', to get a popup printing
  window.

vis-00-03-02a  26th September 1998  
- DAWNFILE driver is made platform dependent.
  (It is now compilable both at both Unix and NT without necessity
   of C macros like WIN32.)

  /vis~/clear/scene.
- OpenInventor: Correct some upper -> lower case mess (Guy Barrand)
- G4RayView: syntax bug fixes.

4th August 1998 Andy Walkden
I made some changes to OpenGL code...
The changes are (i) to tidy up some redundant hidden line 
removal function calls, (ii) to put some hidden line removal 
code in G4OpenGLScene::AddPrimitive(G4Polyhedron) and 
(iii) to add an option to generate an encapsulated postscript 
file of the current view in OpenGLXm. There is now a button 
in the Miscellany pulldown of the main menubar to bring up 
a shell in which you can specify a filename, colour or black 
and white and request the creation of a .eps file. The 
code is to be found in G4OpenGLXView, and so is not bound 
to the Xm user. Also it needs fixing for some Mesa 
implementations, and the HP CDE environment manages to stuff 
things up when rendering to a pixmap (although CDE makes a 
mess of most other things as well, so this isn't
disastrous).


vis-00-01-08  21th July 1998  John Allison
- Removed automatic refresh from /vis/camera/reset in G4VisCommandsCamera.cc.

vis-00-01-07b  21th July 1998  Satoshi Tanaka

- Changed GNUmakefile.G4VIS_BUILD to G4VIS_BUILD.gmk

vis-00-06-07  19th June 1998  John Allison
- Defined G4_SOLVE_VIS_TEMPLATES in G4VIS_USE.gmk.  Needs
  the head version of GNUmakefile.architecture.

  //    G4double unit = G4UIcommand::valueOf (unitString);
        G4double unit = G4UnitDefinition::GetValueOf (unitString);

vis-00-06-04  10th June 1998  John Allison

- Committed an interim version of README.
- Moved G4BoundingSphereScene from management to modeling.
- First attempt at defining the "scene" as lists of models.
- Removed some unnecessary checks in G4VisManMess*.

vis-00-06-03  27th May   1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- DAWNFILE driver is added. It is to generate g4.prim file
  under the current directory.  And make DAWN or DAVID invoke 
  using the g4.prim file as an input. For details, see the blackboard 
  document.

21st May 1998 Andy Walkden
- Added hidden line removal code to G4OpenGLView. HLR utilises OpenGL's
  stencil buffer, but still the drawn lines are a little fragmented
  (an effect seen often when depth buffering is used to resolve pixel
  rendering disputes). 
- HLR requires wireframe rendering, filled polygon rendering and then wireframe
  rendering again. Hence, three visits to the kernel help to slow HLR
  rendering right down.

vis-00-06-02  20th May   1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- Added G4VisFeaturesOfDAWNFILE.hh, cc
- Revised visualization/GNUmakefile, GNUmakefile.G4VIS_BUILD,
  GNUmakefile.G4VIS_USE
- These are for DAWNFILE driver in preparation, which enables to
  invoke DAVID directly from Geant4.

vis-00-06-01a 20th May   1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- code refinement of FukuiRenderer driver

vis-00-06-01  29th April 1998  John Allison
- Introduced non-pure virtual functions
  Establish/DecommissionSpecials (G4PhysicalVolumeModel&) in
  G4VGraphicsScene with implementation of the former in G4VScene.
  Modified G4PhysicalVolumeModel to use it; also protected
  G4PhysicalVolumeModel against non-implementation of
  Establish/DecommissionSpecials.
- Template instantiations in G4RayView made exclusive to GNU_GCC
- Some minor changes under test - see test/History.

27th April 1998 Andy Walkden
- altered OpenGLView's structure a little. Now, G4OpenGLXmView is a
  type of (inherits from) G4OpenGLXView.
- made code for haloing effects common to all OpenGL views.
- changed XUnmapWindow in G4OpenGLXView::~G4OpenGLXView to XDestroyWindow
  (idea of Guy's)

27th April 1998 Guy Barrand
- vis/OPACS : remove Begin/EndModeling in G4GoScene.

vis-00-05-06  23rd April 1998  John Allison

- Tidied CreateScene/View.
- Continued BaBar development.

15th April 1998  John Allison
- Added test/EucIntfce/, test/Bogus/ and test/babar_utils/ for BaBar test code.
  Also a new main() in BaBarCallListTest.cc.  Also a data file call_list.dat.
  See babar_utils/README.
- Camera commands, except spin and orbit, no longer initiate draw.
- Text is blue for time being (visible on black or white background.)

15th April 1998 : Guy Barrand
- From discussion with John and Simone G4VToolkit 
  has been renamed to G4VInteractorManager.

vis-00-05-04a  11th April 1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- Code improvements in DAWN driver
- (1) View parameters are sent to DAWN only at drawing times.
- (2) Way of getting marker size are made simpler by using
-     G4VScene::GetMarkerRadius ()  etc.

vis-00-05-04  8th April 1998  John Allison
- Small bug fix - then tag for Easter.

HEAD  6th April 1998  John Allison
- Added error printing to G4OpenGLScene::AddPrimitive (const G4Text& text).
- Added /vis~/draw/text.
- Added units to /vis~/draw/axes.
- Began the job of restructuring vis commands; so there is a new class
  G4VisCommandsCameraMessengers for starters!

HEAD  4th April 1998  John Allison
- Removed automatic drawing after /vis~/set commands.  Now an explicit
  redraw is necessary, but it allows you to change parameters during
  building a view.  For example to superimpose projected hits on a
  section:
    /vis~/clear/view
    /vis~/set/section_plane on 0 0 20 cm 0 0 1
    /vis~/draw/current
    /vis~/set/section_plane off
    /run/beamOn
- Fixed small bug in OpenGL for section drawing.
- Made some small improvements in G4ViewParameters.

vis-00-05-03  4th April 1998  John Allison
- Re-engineered maintenance of current depth, etc.  Needed new method
  G4VGraphicsScene::BeginModeling (G4PhysicalVolumeModel&) in
  graphics_reps.  The result is much cleaner model and modeling
  parameters classes.  Also, the current depth, physical volume and
  logical volume are immediately available as protected pointers in
  G4VScene.
- Required G4VScene::Begin/EndModeling to be invoked from subclass.
- Introduced G4NullModel to hold modeling parameters.  This avoids
  having to create a G4VModel for each graphics primitive.

HEAD  3rd April 1998  John Allison
- Added GetMarkerDiameter/Radius to G4VScene.
- Bug fix in G4VScene::GetMarkerSize.
- Removed GetCurrentPhysicalVolume from G4PhysicalVolumeModel - now in
  G4ModelingParameters (but might move again soon!).
- test/GNUmakefile now uses "$(MAKE) separate" for vis libraries.
- test19 recognises argument "1" as a verbose flag value.

HEAD April 2, 98 G.Barrand
- Modifications for Win32/NT.
- G4VIS_BUILD_[OIX, OIWIN32]_DRIVER, G4VIS_USE_[OIX, OIWIN32]

vis-00-05-02  26th March 1998  John Allison
- Added GetMarkerSize to G4VScene.
- Made ~G4VisManager virtual.
- Added current logical volume and current physical volume to working
  space in modeling parameters.  So it is no longer necessary to cast
  to G4PhysicalVolumeModel; all such casts removed.
- Moved nested classes out of G4RayView.

HEAD March 24, 98 G.Cosmo
- Modified G4VisManMessExpert.cc to correctly use random numbers
  by calling directly G4UniformRand().

HEAD March 24, 98 G.Barrand
- GNUmakefile : MAKESHLIB changed in G4MAKESHLIB

vis-00-05-01a  24 March 1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- Geometry tree can be obtained by, e.g., 
  % grep PVName g4.prim > g4.tree

vis-00-05-01  23rd March 1998  John Allison
- Made RegisterGraphicsSystems pure virtual.
- Added verbose level control to printing at initialization.
- Fixed (hopefully) bug in scene deletion.
- Made AddPrimitive (const G4Text/Circle/Square) pure virtual.
  (Had to add dummy void G4VRML1SCENE::AddPrimitive (const G4Text&).)
- Made AddPrimitive (const G4Polymarker&) virtual again.

- First tag with modeling under visualization.
  Here's what you need to do...
    cd prototype
    cvs update -A -d -P modeling
    cd visualization
    cvs update -r vis-00-04-04 -d -P
  Change the following lines in your GNUmakefile...
    CPPFLAGS += -I../../visualization/modeling/include
    LDFLAGS  += -L../../visualization/modeling/$(G4SYSTEM)
    Remove: @cd ../../modeling      &&   $(MAKE)

vis-00-04-03  4th March 1998  John Allison
- Last tag with modeling at same level as visualization.
- Renamed near and far (VC++ keywords) in G4ViewParameters.cc.
- Removed unnecessary #include <strstream.h> or adapted for WIN32.

vis-00-04-02b  22nd February 1998  Satoshi Tanaka
- Split G4VIS_BUILD_VRML1_DRIVER into G4VIS_BUILD_VRML_DRIVER 
                                 and  G4VIS_BUILD_VRMLFILE_DRIVER.
- Split G4VIS_USE_VRML1          into G4VIS_USE_VRML           
                                 and  G4VIS_USE_VRMLFILE.

- Tagged a few improvement in OpenGL

vis-00-03-01 26th January 1998  John Allison
- Old environment variables abandoned - see visualization/README.
- G4VisManager is now instantiated *and* deleted in main().
- G4VisRegisterGraphicsSystem.icc replaced by
  MyVisManager::RegisterGraphicsSystems as a way - now optional - of
  a user overriding the default graphics system registration.

Januray 20 , 98 G. Barrand

- Implement object rotation in OPACS driver
  
Januray 19 , 98 G. Barrand

- Correct OpenInventor code so that it is ANSI-C++
  and then compiles with OSF1/cxx, HP-UX/aCC.

7th January 1998  John Allison
- Restructuring to use modeling category.

December 19, 97 G. Cosmo - (alpha03)

- 1st December 1997 - John Allison.
- This is interim code for testing by the visualization
  group and it will be tagged soon.  You must update to the
  head of graphics_reps and visualization simulatanouesly.
  It coworks (I hope - it's difficult to be 100% sure about
  this since I have a few changes for other categories in
  the pipeline - see previous email) with:
    digits+hits              digi-00-02-01
    events+tracks            event-00-02-01
    geometry                 HEAD
    global                   global-00-02-01

    tracking                 tracking-00-02-01
- Addition of:
    visualization/GNUmakefile.transition_to_G4VIS_BUILD
    visualization/GNUmakefile.transition_to_G4VIS_USE
    visualization/GNUmakefile.vis_cppflags_for_G4VIS_USE
  to turn the existing environment variables into the
  to-be-adopted G4VIS_... variables - see visualization/test/README.
- Consequent changes to other visualization GNUmakefiles.
- New way of instantiating graphics systems:
  Set the appropriate environment variables and include and
  compile G4VisRegisterGraphicsSystems.icc in your main():
    ...
    #include G4VisRegisterGraphicsSystems.icc
    ...
    main() {
      ...
- Added G4VisFeaturesOfXXX files which simple return a G4String.
 (Guy, Jeff, would you like to join this scheme?)
- Added commands /vis~/delete/scene and /vis~/delete/view.
- Added /vis~/show/view to test19.odb.
