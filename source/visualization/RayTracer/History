History file for Ray Tracer category
---------------------------------------

24th May 2011 Ben Morgan (raytracer-V09-03-06)
- sources.cmake : Added additional includes, definitions and link libraries
  to build X11 component of RayTracer, if it's enabled by the user.
  CMake functionality added to trunk at revision 49996.

20th May 2011  Ben Morgan
- CMakeLists.txt : Added G4VIS_ALLOC_EXPORT compiler definition via 
  add_definitions so it's applied to all sources in this module. We
  don't add this definition at the visualization category level because
  only raytracer uses it. It can be moved higher later.

2nd March 2011  John Allison (raytracer-V09-03-05)
- Fix bug introduced by fix to Coverity warnings.

1st March 2011  John Allison
- G4RayTracerViewer::DrawView: Trap recursive calls, thus avoiding
  warning messages for each pixel when endOfEventAction is "refresh".
  EndOfEventAction is not relevant for Ray Tracer.  At the present
  time, Ray Tracer takes no notice of the scene.  Perhaps in future,
  it will, but G4RayTracerViewer should still ignore those recursive
  calls.
- Fix Coverity warnings.

23, December L. Garnier 
- GNUmakefile : Remove OpenGL/Qt stuff from Makefile

27th October 2010  Gabriele Cosmo (raytracer-V09-03-04)
- Restored DLL setup as originally. Withdrawn changes in last tag.

19th October 2010  Gabriele Cosmo (raytracer-V09-03-03)
- Replaced G4VIS_ALLOC_EXPORT flag with G4ALLOC_EXPORT for DLL exported
  symbols.

14th June 2010  Gabriele Cosmo  (raytracer-V09-03-02)
- Added missing virtual destructor to G4VRTScanner, G4RTXScanner and
  G4RTSimpleScanner.

30th May 2010  John Allison  (raytracer-V09-03-01)
- G4RayTracerSceneHandler: Added AddCompound(const G4VDigi&).

- G4RayTrajectory.hh: Added DrawTrajectory() ready for i_mode migration.

15th November 2009  John Allison  (raytracer-V09-02-02)
- Formal tag to record fixing of bugzilla Problem 1072.
  o There is no change of source code.
  o This was actullay fixed in raytracer-V09-02-00, which is already accepted.

21st October 2009  John Allison  (raytracer-V09-02-01 coworks greps-V09-02-02)
- Added AddCompound (const G4THitsMap<G4double>&) methods.
  o Prevents warnings about hiding - calls G4VSceneHandler base class.

16 September 2009  John Allison  (raytracer-V09-02-00)
- Cosmetic adjustments and tagging.

  parameters [bugzilla Problem 1072]

14th June 2007  John Allison  (raytracer-V08-03-01)

17th November 2006  Joseph Perl  (raytracer-V08-01-02)
- Deprecate /vis/rayTracer/backgroundColour.
- Hasn't worked for some time anyway.
- Users are instead referred to /vis/viewer/set/background.

14th November 2006  John Allison  (raytracer-V08-01-01)

  anti-aliasing.  Currently no change of functionality.

11th January 2006  John Allison  (raytracer-V08-00-00)
- Reorganisation (needs visman-V08-00-02):
  o Allowed multiple ray tracers.
  o Separated out the original ray tracer into G4TheRayTracer, to be
    used by viewers.
  o Made G4RTMessenger a smart singleton that queries the vis manager
    for tracers.
  o Caused G4RayTracer to instantiate a default ray tracer if the user
    wants to use /vis/rayTracer commands without the benefit of the
    vis system (scene handlers and viewers).

4th December 2005  Makoto Asai (raytracer-V07-01-08)
- Correct initialization of G4RTTrackingAction and G4RTSteppingAction

28th November 2005  Jane Tinslay (raytracer-V07-01-07)

- Implemented window positioning.

28th October 2005  Makoto Asai (raytracer-V07-01-05)
- Working tag for merging "envelope" into G4Region.
- This tag does not contain raytracer-V07-01-04 tag that might be
  already done by J. Allison but does not yet appear on this file.

13th October September 2005  John Allison (raytracer-V07-01-04)
(On branch raytracer-V07-01-01-branch; changes *not* merged into head -
need to cvs update -j raytracer-V07-01-02 -j raytracer-V07-01-01-branch.)
- Migrated to <sstream>.
- Default background black - can be changed by /vis/viewer/set/background.
- GNUmakefile: Removed temporary CPPFLAGS += -DG4VIS_BUILD_RAYTRACERX_DRIVER.

30th September 2005  Joseph Perl (raytracer-V07-01-03)
New tag to include change Makoto made an hour after V07-01-02 was tagged.
Change seems to just involve passing pWorld to material list where no argument was passed in previous version.

16th September 2005  John Allison (raytracer-V07-01-02)
(On branch raytracer-V07-01-01-branch; changes merged into head.)
- Bug fix (black holes): Made small epsilon push into world to ensure inside.

20th July 2005  John Allison (raytracer-V07-01-01)
- Protected RayTracerX by G4VIS macro.

17th July 2005  John Allison (raytracer-V07-01-00)
- Introduced RayTracerX.  RayTracerX opens an X window and builds up
  the picture, refining it gradually.  Already calculated pixels are
  not recalculated, so it is as efficient as a top-to-bottom raster
  scan.  It produces a jpeg file as well, just like RayTracer.

11th June 2004  Gabriele Cosmo  (raytracer-V06-01-00)
- Use global flag G4VIS_ALLOC_EXPORT to export extern symbols for DLLs.
  Modified GNUmakefile and rearranged usage of extern symbols in classes.

12th November 2003  Mark Donszelmann
- GNUmakefile: added Modeling/include directory to compile on Windows.

6th November 2003  John Allison  (raytracer-V05-02-04, vis-V05-02-03)
- GNUmakefile: rationalised.

4th October 2003  Gabriele Cosmo  (raytracer-V05-02-03)
- GNUmakefile:
  o added dependency to new module "geometry/navigation".
  o replaced "digits+hits" with "digits_hits".
- Coworks with "geometry-V05-02-00" and "digits_hits-V05-02-00".

25th September 2003  Hisaya Kurashige  (raytracer-V05-02-02)
- Modify GNUmakefile to use processes/cuts category 

18th September 2003  John Allison  (raytracer-V05-02-01, greps-V05-02-00)
- Introduced G4VRTScanner and its default concrete implementation,
  G4RTSimpleScanner.  It controls the shooting order of rays.
- Added new command /vis/rayTracer/backgroundColour.

4th August 2003  Makoto Asai  (raytracer-V05-02-00)

- Tag for changes in G4VTrajectory, etc.

22nd April 2002  John Allison
- Workaround for pseudo-parallel/orthogonal projection in Ray Tracer.  It is
  perspective projection with *very* small field angle (perMillion).

22nd Nov 2001   Gabriele Cosmo  (raytracer-V03-02-02)
- G4RTJpegMaker.cc: added check on ISO compliance for binary mode on
  file streamsi, to allow compilation on non-ISO compilers.

13th Nov 2001   Hajime Yoshida and Minamimoto (raytracer-V03-02-01)
- Updation of G4RTJpegMaker.cc for Windows platform.

14th July 2001  John Allison  (raytracer-V03-02-00)
- Changed some arguments in G4RayTracer.hh from G4ThreeVector to const
  G4ThreeVector& to keep Sun compiler happy.

- Added G4std:: in a few places to obtain ISO compliance.
- Change "char*" to "const char*" in G4OutBitStream::CopyByte(...).
