History file for Ray Tracer category
---------------------------------------

15th November 2019, Gabriele Cosmo (raytracer-V10-05-01)
- Fixed cases of implicit type conversions from size_t to G4int.

25th October 2019 Ben Morgan (raytracer-V10-05-00)
- Link to X11 imported targets when building X11 driver

9th November 2018  Gabriele Cosmo (raytracer-V10-04-04)
- G4RTMessenger: fixed printout typos.

24th October 2018  John Allison (raytracer-V10-04-03)
- G4RayTracerSceneHandler::BuildVisAttsMap:
  o Use name,copyNo constructor of G4ModelingParameters::PVPointerCopyNo.
    (The nodeID constructor was removed in modeling-V10-04-15).

17th May 2018  Jonathan Madsen (raytracer-V10-04-01)
- updated "thread-local-static-var" model to
  "function-returning-thread-local-static-reference" model
  which fixes Windows DLL + MT

20th March 2018  Makoto Asai (raytracer-V10-04-00)
- G4RayTrajectory.cc
  o Use HyperStep of G4ParallelWorldProcess to draw volumes
    defined in a parallel world.
  o sources.cmake and GNUmakefile are modified accordingly.

7th May 2017  John Allison (raytracer-V10-03-04)
- G4RayTracerViewer.cc:
  o Expanded filename numbering to 4 digits, zero filled, e.g.,
      g4RayTracer.viewer-1_0000.jpeg
      g4RayTracer.viewer-1_0001.jpeg
    etc.
  o Useful for producing many files for a movie.

5th May 2017  John Allison (raytracer-V10-03-03)
- Pick up vis attributes of the geometry from the vis scene (G4Scene).
  Make a map of the vis attributes by touchable path from the G4Scene in
  G4RayTracerSceneHandler. When a touchable is encountered in the Ray
  Tracer, pick up the vis attributes from the map instead of from the
  geometry tree.  For simple use, for example
    /vis/open RayTracer  # or RayTracerX
    /vis/drawVolume
    /vis/viewer/flush
  the result will be the same as before. But when a user selects a
  sub-component, for example
    /vs/drawVolume Shape1
  the Ray Tracer will now draw only Shape1. The Ray Tracer will also
  follow changes made in other viewers by copying the view. For example
  the user can chose a viewing angle and zoom, and change the visibility
  and colour of volumes, using, say, a Qt viewer (say viewer-0), and see
  the effect in the Ray Tracer:
    /vis/open RayTracer  # Gets the same scene as the Qt viewer
    /vis/viewer/copyViewFrom viewer-0  # Copies camera parameters, or...
    /vis/viewer/set/all viewer-0       # ...copies all parameters
    /vis/viewerflush

19th February 2017  John Allison (raytracer-V10-03-02)
- G4RTXScanner.cc:
  o Changed back to XA_RGB_BEST_MAP. (I don't know what was going on
    but it seems OK now.)
- G4RayTracer.cc and G4RayTracerViewer.cc:
  o The ray tracer pointer is now passed from G4RayTracer to
    G4RayTracerViewer so that there is no need to instantiate it there.
    This works for both sequential and MT modes.  (G4RayTracerViewer.cc
    no longer has any need for special action for G4MULTITHREADED - it
    is all done in G4RayTracer.cc.)
  o Introduced G4RayTracerViewer::Initialise.  Fixes a bug whereby the
    jpeg for RayTracer was always 600x600.

22nd February 2017  John Allison (raytracer-V10-03-00)
- G4RTXScanner.cc: Changed XA_RGB_BEST_MAP to XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP.
  (It seems XA_RGB_BEST_MAP no longer available on Mac XQuartz 2.7.11.)

- Shadow clean.

8th February 2012  John Allison  (raytracer-V09-05-01)
- G4RayTracerViewer.cc, G4TheRayTracer.hh/cc:
  Adopt fix proposed by jasondet@gmail.com to fix Bug #1274.
- G4RayTracerViewer.cc:
  o Move window size hints to constructor from SetView, so that
    NColumn/Row are never changed, even if window size hints change
    (e.g., as a result of /vis/viewer/set/all).  It is not possible to
    change NColumn/Row after instantiation.
- G4TheRayTracer.cc:
  o Ensure unit vector for the ray shooter.  (Otherwise it can cause a
    G4Exception in G4ParticleChange::CheckIt.)

7th February 2012  John Allison  (raytracer-V09-05-00)
- G4RayTracerViewer.cc:
  o G4RayTracerViewer::SetView: Fix up-vector bug #1274.
  o Move window size hints to constructor from SetView, so that
    NColumn/Row are never changed, even if window size hints change
    (e.g., as a result of /vis/viewer/set/all).  It is not possible to
    change NColumn/Row after instantiation.
- G4TheRayTracer.cc:
  o Ensure unit vector for the ray shooter.  (Otherwise it can cause a
    G4Exception in G4ParticleChange::CheckIt.)

17th June 2011 Ben Morgan (raytracer-V09-04-04)
- sources.cmake : Changed to use GEANT4_USE_RAYTRACER_X11 variable.

24th May 2011 Ben Morgan (raytracer-V09-04-03)
- sources.cmake : Added additional includes, definitions and link libraries
  to build X11 component of RayTracer, if it's enabled by the user.
  CMake functionality added to trunk at revision 49996.

20th May 2011  Ben Morgan (raytracer-V09-04-02)
- CMakeLists.txt : Added G4VIS_ALLOC_EXPORT compiler definition via 
  add_definitions so it's applied to all sources in this module. We
  don't add this definition at the visualization category level because
  only raytracer uses it. It can be moved higher later.

2nd March 2011  John Allison (raytracer-V09-04-01)
- Fix bug introduced by fix to Coverity warnings.

1st March 2011  John Allison (raytracer-V09-04-00)
- G4RayTracerViewer::DrawView: Trap recursive calls, thus avoiding
  warning messages for each pixel when endOfEventAction is "refresh".
  EndOfEventAction is not relevant for Ray Tracer.  At the present
  time, Ray Tracer takes no notice of the scene.  Perhaps in future,
  it will, but G4RayTracerViewer should still ignore those recursive
  calls.
- Fix Coverity warnings.

23, December L. Garnier 
- GNUmakefile : Remove OpenGL/Qt stuff from Makefile

27th October 2010  Gabriele Cosmo (raytracer-V09-03-04)

15th November 2009  John Allison  (raytracer-V09-02-02)
- Formal tag to record fixing of bugzilla Problem 1072.
  o There is no change of source code.
  o This was actullay fixed in raytracer-V09-02-00, which is already accepted.

21st October 2009  John Allison  (raytracer-V09-02-01 coworks greps-V09-02-02)

  anti-aliasing.  Currently no change of functionality.

11th January 2006  John Allison  (raytracer-V08-00-00)
- Reorganisation (needs visman-V08-00-02):
  o Allowed multiple ray tracers.
  o Separated out the original ray tracer into G4TheRayTracer, to be
    used by viewers.
  o Made G4RTMessenger a smart singleton that queries the vis manager
    for tracers.
  o Caused G4RayTracer to instantiate a default ray tracer if the user
    wants to use /vis/rayTracer commands without the benefit of the
    vis system (scene handlers and viewers).

4th December 2005  Makoto Asai (raytracer-V07-01-08)

- Working tag for merging "envelope" into G4Region.
- This tag does not contain raytracer-V07-01-04 tag that might be
  already done by J. Allison but does not yet appear on this file.

13th October September 2005  John Allison (raytracer-V07-01-04)
(On branch raytracer-V07-01-01-branch; changes *not* merged into head -
need to cvs update -j raytracer-V07-01-02 -j raytracer-V07-01-01-branch.)
- Migrated to <sstream>.
- Default background black - can be changed by /vis/viewer/set/background.
- GNUmakefile: Removed temporary CPPFLAGS += -DG4VIS_BUILD_RAYTRACERX_DRIVER.

30th September 2005  Joseph Perl (raytracer-V07-01-03)
New tag to include change Makoto made an hour after V07-01-02 was tagged.
Change seems to just involve passing pWorld to material list where no argument was passed in previous version.

16th September 2005  John Allison (raytracer-V07-01-02)
(On branch raytracer-V07-01-01-branch; changes merged into head.)
- Bug fix (black holes): Made small epsilon push into world to ensure inside.

20th July 2005  John Allison (raytracer-V07-01-01)
- Protected RayTracerX by G4VIS macro.

17th July 2005  John Allison (raytracer-V07-01-00)
- Introduced RayTracerX.  RayTracerX opens an X window and builds up
  the picture, refining it gradually.  Already calculated pixels are
  not recalculated, so it is as efficient as a top-to-bottom raster
  scan.  It produces a jpeg file as well, just like RayTracer.

11th June 2004  Gabriele Cosmo  (raytracer-V06-01-00)
- Use global flag G4VIS_ALLOC_EXPORT to export extern symbols for DLLs.
  Modified GNUmakefile and rearranged usage of extern symbols in classes.

4th October 2003  Gabriele Cosmo  (raytracer-V05-02-03)
- GNUmakefile:
  o added dependency to new module "geometry/navigation".
  o replaced "digits+hits" with "digits_hits".
- Coworks with "geometry-V05-02-00" and "digits_hits-V05-02-00".

25th September 2003  Hisaya Kurashige  (raytracer-V05-02-02)
- Modify GNUmakefile to use processes/cuts category 

18th September 2003  John Allison  (raytracer-V05-02-01, greps-V05-02-00)
- Introduced G4VRTScanner and its default concrete implementation,
  G4RTSimpleScanner.  It controls the shooting order of rays.
- Added new command /vis/rayTracer/backgroundColour.

4th August 2003  Makoto Asai  (raytracer-V05-02-00)

  perspective projection with *very* small field angle (perMillion).

22nd Nov 2001   Gabriele Cosmo  (raytracer-V03-02-02)
- G4RTJpegMaker.cc: added check on ISO compliance for binary mode on
  file streamsi, to allow compilation on non-ISO compilers.

13th Nov 2001   Hajime Yoshida and Minamimoto (raytracer-V03-02-01)
- Updation of G4RTJpegMaker.cc for Windows platform.

14th July 2001  John Allison  (raytracer-V03-02-00)
- Changed some arguments in G4RayTracer.hh from G4ThreeVector to const
  G4ThreeVector& to keep Sun compiler happy.
