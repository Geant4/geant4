- Maximun number of generated g4.prim files in the destination
  directory is customizable as: "setenv G4DAWNFILE_MAX_FILE_NUM  N"
  (N is the integer greater than or equal to 1. The default value is 1.)

- Bug fix

DAWN-00-03-03	Satoshi TANAKA	Nov 30, 1998  
- Destination directiory of g4.prim and g4.eps is customizable 
  with the environmental variable "G4DAWNFILE_DEST_DIR".

  Unix:
   % setenv G4DAWNFILE_DEST_DIR   directory_name/

   For example, 

   % setenv G4DAWNFILE_DEST_DIR   /tmp/

   Do not forget to add "/" at the end of the directory name.

  NT: 
   DOS> set G4DAWNFILE_DEST_DIR   directory_name\

   Do not forget to add "\" at the end of the directory name.

- Auto incremetaion of output file names is supported.
  Names of generated files are:

   DAWN-format files: g4.prim, g4_1.prim, g4_2.prim, ... , g4_100.prim 
   EPS files        : g4.eps , g4_1.eps , g4_2.eps , ... , g4_100.eps

  Maximal number of files in one directory is restricted in order to 
  avoid explosion of your hard disk. The maximal number is hard-coded.
  You can revise is by editing enum of G4DAWNFILEScene.hh.

  Note that the incrementation is done as follows (pseudo codes)

    filename = "g4.prim" // initialization

    while( filename already exists in the dest directory )
    {
	  increment filename
    }

  It means that if you delete file "g4.prim" in the destination directory,
  the file name in the next generation is still g4.prim.
