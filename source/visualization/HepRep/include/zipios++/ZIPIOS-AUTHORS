The files zipios++/directory.h and zipios++/directory.cpp originate
from the dir_it library written by Dietmar Kuehl (it's available for
download at http://www.boost.org)

zipios++.spec contributed by Rui Miguel Silva Seabra

libtool/shared library patch contributed by Arkadiusz Miskiewicz (arekm)

Russel Winder (r.winder@180sw.com) did the work of amending the code to

Ross Burton (r.burton@180sw.com) transformed zipios++.spec into
zipios++.spec.in and made it more RedHat tradition conformant.
