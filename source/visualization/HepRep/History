12th July 2003 Mark Donszelmann
- Renamed XMLHepRepWriter to G4HepRepFileXMLWriter and moved its header to include.
  Fixed initialization of some variabled in G4HepRep and G4HepRepSceneHandler, found
  by valgrind. Removed dependency in gzio.cc of fdopen (platform specific).

11th July 2003 Mark Donszelmann
- Removed the HepRepStreamer and replaced it by a fully functional HepRep implementation
  in C++. Added compression using ZLIB and ZIPIOS++. Moved private header files to
  subdirectories of include so that they do not get copied by the "gmake includes"
  command.
  The current HepRep files are invalid, but we first need to get rid of some memory
  leaks, using Linux, so we check this in.

30th May 2003  John Allison
- Eliminated pedantic warnings at head (johna-030530) and on
  geant4-05-01-ref-02 (vis-V05-00-02).

29th May 2003 Mark Donszelmann and Joseph Perl (mark-joseph-050329)
- Modified G4HepRepSceneHandler (HEPREP2) to write more complete heprep, including
  attributes.
- Copied new Streamer from FREEHEP library.

28th February 2003  Joseph Perl
- Modified G4HepRepFileSceneHandler to allow some volumes to be initially invisible.

24th January 2003  Joseph Perl
- Modified G4HepRepFileSceneHandler:AddThis (const G4VTrajectory& traj)
  to incorporate G4Attributes into the HepRep1 file.
- Moved some of HepRepXMLWriter's warning messages into ifdef debug blocks.

11th December 2002  John Allison  (vis-V04-01-10)

4th February 2002  Joseph Perl  (vis-V04-00-01)
- Check for missing hierarchy layers in HepRepXMLWriter.
  (Not strictly needed since have a culled layer check in SceneHandler,
  but may be useful in other applications of HepRepXMLWriter).

3rd February 2002  Joseph Perl
- Detect transient data by testing for
  !fpCurrentPV || fReadyForTransients
  rather than just fReadyForTransients

1st February 2002  Joseph Perl
- Defer file opening until first real HepRepType is to be written.
- Moved HepRep code from AddThis to AddPrimitive.
- Add additional levels to hierarchy if any appear to have been
  removed by culling.
- Add visibility attribute.

29th January 2002  Joseph Perl
- Relocate file-opening logic to constructor and ShowView
  (had been in SetView).

28th January 2002  Joseph Perl
- Produce hierarchical output rather than flat HepRepType structure.
- Handle trajectories as well as detector geometry.
- Output files now named G4Data<n>.heprep where n increments with each open.

19th November 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-19)
- Added G4HEPREPFILEDEBUG to control debug code.
- Changed <fstream.h> to "g4std/fstream".
- Changed cout to G4cout, endl to G4endl.

6th November 2001  John Allison  (HepRep-pure-C++-1st-version)
- Removed HepRep files G4HepRep.hh, G4HepRepSceneHandler.hh,
  G4HepRepViewer.hh, G4HepRep.cc, G4HepRepSceneHandler.cc and
  G4HepRepViewer.cc (recoverable with tag HepRep-Java-version).
- Added HepRepFile from version of 27th September 2001  Joseph Perl.
  First pure C++ version (eliminates need for Java jni or freehep).
  Named as HepRepFile rather than HepRep.
- GNUmakefile: removed CPPFLAGS += -DHEPREP and CPPFLAGS += -DDEBUG.
- README: completely re-written for HepRepFile.

6th November 2001  John Allison  (HepRep-Java-version)
- Tagged before major revision.

4th September 2001  Joseph Perl
- minor improvements to README.

26th August 2001  Joseph Perl
- handle PolyHedron.getNoFacets()==0 and improve README.
