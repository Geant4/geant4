    not just for the case of the world volume.
- G4ASCIITreeMessenger.cc:
  o Improved guidance.

14th August 2016  John Allison (vistree-V10-02-01)
- G4ASCIITree.cc and G4ASCIITreeMessenger.cc:
  o Changed default verbosity to 1 (shows logical volume names).

5th April 2016  John Allison  (vistree-V10-02-00)
- G4ASCIITreeSceneHandler.cc:
  o Prevented multiple writing of the informational header on
    the output file.

8th March 2015  John Allison  (vistree-V10-01-04 needs modeling-V10-01-01)
- G4ASCIITreeSceneHandler: Added polyhedron dump for verbosity >=7.

12th January 2012  John Allison  (vistree-V09-05-00)
- G4VTreeSceneHandler.hh:
  o Removed empty implementations of Begin/EndPrimitives, so now
    picks up the default (and correct non-empty default
    implementations in G4VSceneHandler).  The problem is that
    objectTransformation must be set to something.  This was causing a
    G4Exception in G4VisManager::DrawT.

- Fixed directory name (trailing /).
- Fixed memory leak in G4ASCIITreeSceneHandler.

13th September 2004  John Allison  (vistree-V06-02-00)
- Improved ASCIITree:
  verbosity >= 3: prints volume, density of all volumes in hierarchy.
  verbosity >= 4: calculates the mass of the complete geometry tree taking
    into account daughters up to the depth specified for each physical
    volume in the current scene.  Culling is ignored so that all volumes
    are processed.  The calculation is quite tricky, since it involves
    subtracting the mass of that part of the mother that is occupied by
    each daughter and then adding the mass of the daughter, and so on
    down the heirarchy.  Uses G4PhysicalVolumeMassScene.
  Added option to write to file (/vis/ASCIITree/set/outFile).

  G4GAGTreeScenehandler.
