--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2022-11-06 John Allison (vistree-V11-00-02)
- Eliminate G4cerr and introduce G4warn.
  - `#define G4warn G4cout`
    - The above is temporary until a genuine G4warn output stream is
      implemented.
  - Change G4cerr to G4warn in all cases.
  - Change G4cout to G4warn in those cases where it is clearly
    an error report or a warning.

## 2022-01-28 Ben Morgan (vistree-V11-00-01)
- Replace `geant4_global_library_target` with direct file inclusion and
  call to `geant4_add_category` to define library build from source modules.

## 2021-12-10 Ben Morgan (vistree-V11-00-00)
- Change to new Markdown History format

    picks up the default (and correct non-empty default
    implementations in G4VSceneHandler).  The problem is that
    objectTransformation must be set to something.  This was causing a
    G4Exception in G4VisManager::DrawT.

13th September 2004  John Allison  (vistree-V06-02-00)
- Improved ASCIITree:
  verbosity >= 3: prints volume, density of all volumes in hierarchy.
  verbosity >= 4: calculates the mass of the complete geometry tree taking
    into account daughters up to the depth specified for each physical
    volume in the current scene.  Culling is ignored so that all volumes
    are processed.  The calculation is quite tricky, since it involves
    subtracting the mass of that part of the mother that is occupied by
    each daughter and then adding the mass of the daughter, and so on
    down the heirarchy.  Uses G4PhysicalVolumeMassScene.
  Added option to write to file (/vis/ASCIITree/set/outFile).

  G4GAGTreeScenehandler.
