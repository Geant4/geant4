07 November 2019 Ben Morgan (opengl-V10-05-12)
- Only link to imported targets for Motif and X11
- Remove inclusion of QT_USE_FILE from CMake scripts.
  All usage is now through the qtX_ macros and imported targets
- Only use Wt through imported targets

04 November 2019  John Allison  (opengl-V10-05-11)
- Part of vis-V10-05-26.
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler::ScaledFlush:
  o Extend glFlush scaling to all circumstances (not just in the event loop).

22 October 2019  Gabriele Cosmo (opengl-V10-05-10)
- Rationalise headers inclusion in G4OpenGLQtViewer.cc.

11 Sept 2019  Laurent Garnier (opengl-V10-05-09)
- remove default font size and police

16 July 2019  John Allison (opengl-V10-05-08)
- Part of vis-V10-05-22.
- G4OpenGLImmediateXViewer:
  o Revert fix in OpenGL-V10-05-05. The fix in OpenGL-V10-05-07 is better.

06 July 2019  Guy Barrand (OpenGL-V10-05-07)
- Part of vis-V10-05-21.
- G4OpenGLXmViewer.cc:
  Fix argument compatibility in calls to XmVaCreateSimpleMenuBar and similar.
  Use (KeySym)XK_S instead of 'S', etc.
- G4OpenGLXViewer.cc:
  Improve logic for finding a colormap.

13 June 2019  John Allison (OpenGL-V10-05-06)
- Part of vis-V10-05-20.
- Final changes for introduction of cloud drawing:
  o Follow change of accessor name: GetNumberOfCloudPoints.

10 June 2019  John Allison (OpenGL-V10-05-05)
- Part of vis-V10-05-19.
- G4OpenGLImmediateXViewer:
  Force double buffer context. (This can happen anyway when the display
  list limit is reached in stored mode. Seems to be no problem.) We were
  finding that the single buffer visual gave an X Error (BadMatch) on
  some systems, so let us force the use if a double buffer. All systems
  have double buffers nowadays.
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer and StoredQtViewer:
  Force kernel visit on change of number of cloud points.

29 March 2019  John Allison (opengl-V10-05-04)
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler.cc: Fix Coverity warning. Minor tidying.
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer.cc and G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer.cc:
  In CompareForKernelVisit require kernel visit if section plane changes.
  Note this is required since *for now* sections are made in the base class
  by using Boolean Processor.

24 March 2019  John Allison (opengl-V10-05-03)
- Fix bug in /vis/viewer/set/sectionPlane.
  Involves using G4DisplacedSolid instead of plain G4VSolid.

18 March 2019  Gabriele Cosmo (opengl-V10-05-02)
- Corrected few typos in printout/comments.

10 March 2019  John Allison (opengl-V10-05-01)
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.cc: Tidy.

08 March 2019  John Allison (opengl-V10-05-00)
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.cc:
  o Avoid re-using display lists for markers. They may have their own
    position relative to the overall object transformation.

5 October 2018  John Allison (opengl-V10-04-10)
- In all header files, change
#ifdef G4VIS_BUILD_OPENGL_DRIVER
  to
#if defined (G4VIS_BUILD_OPENGL_DRIVER) || defined (G4VIS_USE_OPENGL)
  and similarly for OPENGLX, XM, QT, WT and WIN32. This is so that a user
  may include the OpenGL headers and use the OpenGL library. This will be
  useful if a user (or a developer) wishes to write a new vis driver
  based on the existing OpenGL code.

11 September 2018  John Allison (opengl-V10-04-09)
- G4OpenGLViewer: Fix shadowing of variable in namespace â€˜CLHEP'.
  o Need #include <CLHEP/Units/SystemOfUnits.h> instead of
    #include "G4SystemOfUnits.hh". Then use, e.g., CLHEP::deg instead
    of deg.

12 August 2018  John Allison (opengl-V10-04-08)
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer::DrawDisplayLists:
  o Remove redundant calls to glColor.
  o Add G4VisAttributes for G4Circle lightFront(circleCentre);

11 August 2018  John Allison (opengl-V10-04-07)
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler::AddPrimitivePreambleInternal
  o Disable GL_LIGHTING for 3D markers (It was already disabled for 2D.
    The problem was that 3D markers became dark with normal lighting.)

24 May 2018  John Allison (opengl-V10-04-06)
- G4OpenGLStoredQtSceneHandler.cc, G4OpenGLQtViewer.cc:
  o Fix gcc-8 warnings.
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.cc: Cosmetic.

25 April 2018  John Allison (opengl-V10-04-05)
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer::CompareForKernelVisit,
  G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer::CompareForKernelVisit:
  o Implement comparison for "colour by density".

24 April 2018  John Allison  (opengl-V10-04-04)
- Migrate to greps-V10-04-04.

13 February 2018 Jonathan Madsen (opengl-V10-04-03)
- Replaced explicit usage of G4Mutex locking/unlocking with
  G4AutoLock pointers initialized with std::defer_lock as this
  enables one to avoid any deadlock or non-locked condition_variable
  waits by using G4AutoLock::owns_mutex()

12 February 2018 Jonathan Madsen (opengl-V10-04-02)
- Updated G4CONDITIONWAIT(...) to new C++11 requirements
- Found probable bug in G4OpenGLQtViewer with condition wait -- not locked
  prior to entering condition, which is an undefined behavior. Adapted
  G4AutoLock to accept std::defer_lock_t (doesn't lock upon construction)
  to prevent deadlock that occurs when the mutex is locked

8th January 2017  John Allison  (opengl-V10-04-01)
- Merged timemovebranch:
  o Moved time window parameters from G4OpenGLStoredViewer to
    G4ViewParameters. Now one can interpolate time window parameters (using
    /vis/viewer/interpolate) and make a movie of particles moving through time.
  o See vis-V10-04-00 History for more details.

14th December 2017  John Allison  (opengl-V10-04-00)
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler::AddPrimitivePreambleInternal:
  o Remove glDrawBuffer(GL_FRONT), which seems to cause problems
    for the case of display list memory being exceeded.

7th November 2017  John Allison  (opengl-V10-03-04)
- G4OpenGLViewer.cc, G4OpenGLQtViewer.cc:
  o Refine content of output of picking.

1st September 2017  Laurent Garnier (opengl-V10-03-03)
- Add patch affecting repaint for external applications. See bugzilla #1959.

23rd May 2017  John Allison (opengl-V10-03-02)
- Hopefully fix gcc-7.1 warnings.

16th May 2017  Laurent Garnier
- Fix DEV-262 bug. Picking was not working for retina display due to a screen factor *2

23rd April 2017  John Allison
- G4OpenGLXViewer.cc: Reverted to XA_RGB_BEST_MAP.
- G4OpenGLViewer.cc:
  o Minor improvement to picking (suppressing "no hits" message).
  o Minor code clean-uo.

18th January 2017  Laurent Garnier
- Merge John's picking branch
 o G4OpenGLViewer, G4OpenGLQtViewer, G4OpenGLSceneHandler, G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer, G4OpenGLViewer

G4OpenGLQtViewer.cc: Change labels of picking points in pick info box

17th January 2017  Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLQtViewer.cc: Change labels of picking points in pick info box

12th January 2017  John Allison (opengl-V10-03-01)
- G4OpenGLImmediate/StoredQtViewer::ShowView: Tidied.
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler::ScaledFlush: Tidied.

6th January 2017  John Allison (opengl-V10-03-00)
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler.cc: Fixed bug in ScaledFlush.

21th November 2016  Laurent Garnier (opengl-V10-02-26)
- Go back on the glCheckFramebufferStatus(): comment out this command

21th November 2016  Laurent Garnier (opengl-V10-02-25)
- Fix the glCheckFramebufferStatus() :
  o G4OpenGLViewer : Check only if Qt driver AND (NOT X + NOT XM + NOT WIN32)
  o G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer,G4OpenGLImmediateQtViewer :
    Remove unnecessary "#if GL_EXT_framebuffer_object"
- G4OpenGL.hh: Avoid the case where an XM and Qt OpenGL viewer came with both OpenGL from
  XM and Qt
  
20th November 2016  John Allison (opengl-V10-02-24)
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer.cc: Removed check on previous colour in
  DrawDisplayLists that was intended to avoid unnecessary calls
  to glColor but which in some circumstances prevented necessary
  calls.  Now glColor is called for all display lists, which is
  probably less demanding than checking in the first place.  Fixes
  the same problem as tag opengl-V10-02-22.

19th November 2016  Laurent Garnier (opengl-V10-02-23)
- G4OpenGLViewer.cc:  add isFramebufferReady() method
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer.cc/G4OpenGLViewer.hh/G4OpenGLImmediateQtViewer.cc/G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer.cc:

- G4OpenGLViewerMessenger:
  o Fix a "variable never used" issue

4th November 2016  Laurent Garnier (opengl-V10-02-20 co-works with interfaces-V10-02-09)
- G4OpenGLQtViewer/G4OpenGLImmediateQtViewer/G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer:
 o Add a Qt signal/slot connection between the UI and QGLViewer. Allow us to better manage interaction between them
 o Remove (multiple) scene tree from a tab to put it in a single, auto-update widget
 o Remove (multiple) viewer properties from a tab to put it in a outside dialog
 o Remove (multiple) pick infos from a tab to put it in a outside dialog
 o Lot of remaning in order to do previous work
 o Fix a bad signal/slot connection for the filter of the scene tree (perhaps a bug in some cases)

23rd September 2016  John Allison (opengl-V10-02-19)
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler::ScaledFlush: Tidied.

21st September 2016  Gabriele Cosmo (opengl-V10-02-18)

- Introduced /vis/ogl/flushAt.

19th September 2016  John Allison (opengl-V10-02-15)
- Needs modeling-V10-02-13 and visman-V10-02-27
- Adapted to the move of Vis Attributes Modifiers back to G4ModelingParameters.
- G4OpenGLQtViewer:
  o Added 
  // Flag to indicate that action was initiated by interaction (mouse
  // click) on the scene tree.  It is used and reset in
  // G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer::CompareForKernelVisit to prevent rebuild
  // in this case.
  bool fMouseOnSceneTree;
- G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer::CompareForKernelVisit:
  o Added this to handle scene tree interaction better:
  // Don't check VisAttributesModifiers if this comparison has been
  // initiated by a mouse interaction on the scene tree.
  if (fMouseOnSceneTree) {
    // Reset the flag.
    fMouseOnSceneTree = false;
  } else {
    // Not initiated by a mouse so compare for kernel visit.
    if (lastVP.GetVisAttributesModifiers() !=
           fVP.GetVisAttributesModifiers()) {
      return true;
    }
  }

15th September 2016  John Allison (opengl-V10-02-14)
- G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer:
  o Re-instated G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer::CompareForKernelVisit:
    Now ignores changes in Vis Attributes modifiers (as before).
- G4OpenGLQtViewer:
  o Uses G4VViewer::TouchableSetVisibility and TouchableSetColour.

12th September 2016  John Allison (opengl-V10-02-13)
- G4OpenGLQtViewer.cc: Added calls to SetTouchable.

11th September 2016  John Allison (opengl-V10-02-12)
- GetColour/GetColor no longer takes an argument.
- Make sure applicable vis attributes are obtained.
  // Get and check applicable vis attributes.
  //   fpVisAttribs = fpViewer->GetApplicableVisAttributes(fpVisAttribs);
  // Note: the vis attributes may have been modified by the viewer.  See
  // code in G4VViewer::GetApplicableVisAttributes.

9th September 2016  John Allison (opengl-V10-02-11)
- Needs modeling-V10-02-11 and visman-V10-02-22.
- Moved Vis Attributes Modifiers (VAMs) from G4ModelingParameters
  to G4ViewParameters.

8th September 2016  John Allison
- G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer:
  o G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer::CompareForKernelVisit:
    . Now simply invokes G4OpenGLStoredViewer::CompareForKernelVisit.
  o Fix bug:
    if (kernelVisitWasNeeded) {  // was fNeedKernelVisit
      displaySceneTreeComponent();
    }

7th September 2016  John Allison
- Fixed visibility check.  Now correctly updates VAMs (Vis Attribute
  Modifiers) when user clicks on visibility buttons.
- G4OpenGLQtViewer.cc:
  o G4OpenGLQtViewer::setCheckComponent sets the VAMs.
  o G4OpenGLQtViewer::sceneTreeComponentSelected becomes empty.

31st August 2016  John Allison (opengl-V10-02-10)

16th June 2016  John Allison  (opengl-V10-02-08)
- G4OpenGLViewer.cc: g4GluLookAt and g4GluPickMatrix:
  o Changed GLfloat to GLdouble.  Fixes a problem with projections
    of scenes with very large, e.g., galactic, size.

14th June 2016  John Allison  (opengl-V10-02-07)
- G4OpenGLXmWindowHandlingCallbacks.cc: Commented out some code in
  void G4OpenGLXmViewer::expose_callback (Widget w, 
                                          XtPointer clientData, 
                                          XtPointer) 
{ ...
//??????????????????????????? This might be a problem in MT mode.
//  glXMakeCurrent (pView->dpy, XtWindow(pView->glxarea), pView->cxMaster);
//  pView->SetView ();
//  pView->ClearView ();
//  pView->DrawView ();
//???????????????????????????? Commented out 14/06/16  JA
}
  This was causing SetView to be called from the Xt loop from the vis
  thread in MT mode.  It didn't like that.  It does seem to be required,
  but keep it there, commented, for now.

7th June 2016  Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLQtViewer: Better quality movie generation (change parameters)

1st June 2016  Laurent Garnier

  o G4OpenGLXViewer::SetView: Added thread awareness regarding
    glXMakeCurrent.  NOTE: This will have to be done for Win32
    for multithreading on Windows.
- Tidying of outdated comments.

2nd May 2016  John Allison  (opengl-V10-02-04)
- G4OpenGLXmViewer.cc: Added glXWaitGL (); glFlush (); to ShowView
  to ensure all items get flushed to screen, even when
  eventsDrawInterval is set >1.
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler.hh: Made Get/SetEventsDrawInterval static
  to match static members changed in opengl-V10-02-03.

23rd April 2016  John Allison  (opengl-V10-02-03)
- /vis/ogl/set/eventsDrawInterval and /vis/ogl/set/displayListLimit:
  Fixed some inconsistencies.
  o G4OpenGLViewerMessenger.cc: eventsDrawInterval now applies also
    to immediate mode.
  o G4OpenGLSceneHandler.hh/cc: Made fEventsDrawInterval and
    fEventsWaitingToBeFlushed static so that they apply to all
    OGL scene handlers.
  o G4OpenGLImmediateSceneHandler.cc: Fixed bug in EndPrimitives2D -
    now calls ScaledFlush.
  o G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.cc: Simply moved static variable
    implementations to near top of file.

- Introduce work for Wt driver. the major change is that with "normal" OpenGL,
  functions are statics and accessible everywhere. This is not the case for
  Wt OpenGL functions. They are only member functions of the WGLWidget because
  they have to be redefined to javascript commands to be send to all browsers
  using the applications. In term of changes in OpenGL library, this only one
  is the introduction of a G4OpenGLWtDrawer which is used to map static GL 
  functions into member functions of WGLWidget object :
  o G4OpenGLViewer : Introduction of a pointer to to WtDrawer
  o G4OpenGL.hh : Include G4OpenGLWtDrawer
- Other changes in Wt component :
  o G4OpenGLImmediateWtViewer : Add methods to handle transformations on 
    vertex position
- sources.cmake : Add G4OpenGLWtDrawer support
- Beginning of OpenGL >1.1 implementation : Alternative for glBegin/glEnd calls
  Will not change anything until G4OPENGL_VERSION_2 is not set (and only set
  for Wt driver for the moment)

- G4OpenGLQtViewer::toggleTransparency: Swapped true<->false.

29th October 2012  John Allison
- G4OpenGLViewer: The following data members have been made static with the
  following initial values, modifiable by: "/vis/ogl/set/printSize", 
  "/vis/ogl/set/printFilename" and used by "/vis/ogl/printEPS", and thus 
  are used by all OGL viewers.  fPrintFilenameIndex is initialised to zero
  and counts on for *all* viewers.

- G4OpenGLQtViewer : Comment out a method and fix a printing caracter non desired 

27th October 2012  John Allison (opengl-V09-05-48, needs visman-V09-05-43)
- Finally solved problem of batch v. non-Qt session!!!
  o Introduced G4OpenGLQt, a base class for G4OpenGLImmediate/StoredQt
    graphics system factories.
  o Implemented G4OpenGLQt::IsUISessionCompatible().  This finds the original
    session, if any.  If the session is a G4UIbatch (which can happen if
    invoked from a command in a macro file), it uses GetPreviousSession
    (recursively if necessary - the command may call another macro or command)
    until the original session, if any, is found.  If there is no original
    session we assume the application is in batch mode, and allow a Qt window.
    It's OK to have a Qt window in batch - one can open a viewer, create a
    scene, set view parameters and /vis/ogl/printEPS.  If there *is* an
    original session, but it is *not* an G4UIQt, we flag it as incompatible.
    A "fallback" graphics system is found, if any, in /vis/sceneHandler/create.

26th October 2012  John Allison
- G4OpenGLImmediate/StoredQt.cc:
  o Use GetG4UIWindow() to tell if G4UIQt has been instantiated.
    Solves problem of batch v. non-Qt session.

23rd October 2012  John Allison
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer.hh:
  o Made CompareForKernelVisit virtual.
- G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer:
  o Introduced G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer::CompareForKernelVisit, which
    is identical to G4OpenGLStoredViewer::CompareForKernelVisit
    except for checking of VisAttributesModifiers, because
    G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer keeps track of its own touchable
    modifiers (fTreeItemModels, etc.).
- G4OpenGLQtViewer.cc:
  o Introduced code to capture changes to visibility (selection) in
    VisAttributesModifiers.  This adds to the code to capture colour
    and transparency introduced in opengl-V09-05-47.

18th October 2012  Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLQtViewer :
 o Fix a Qt < 4.5 issue for ColorDialog
 o Fix a Qt < 4.4 issue for GridLayout::itemAtPosition
 o Fix a crash at exit on Linux SLC5 (he is right!)
 o Fix a compilation warning on SLC5

13th October 2012  John Allison
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler.cc, G4OpenGLImmediateSceneHandler.cc,
  G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.cc, G4OpenGLStoredViewer.cc:
  o Moved depth testing out of display list for polylines and markers.
    This allows on-the-fly changing of hidden markers, i.e., without
    a kernel visit and rebuilding of display lists.

12th October 2012  Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLQtViewer:
  o Prevent context menu to be called in a non-interactive session

12th October 2012  John Allison (opengl-V09-05-47, co-works
interfaces-V09-05-20)
- G4OpenGLQtViewer:
  o Introduced some trial code for capturing touchable colour changes.
  o Changed values to references where possible.
 
12th October 2012  Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLStoredQt/G4OpenGLImmediateQt:
  o Improve instantiation of G4UIQt in all G4VInteractiveSession mode case

11th October 2012  Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLStoredQt/G4OpenGLImmediateQt:
  o Improve instantiation of G4UIQt in terminal mode case

10th October 2012  Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLStoredQt/G4OpenGLImmediateQt:
  o Improve instantiation of G4UIQt in batch mode case

9th October 2012  John Allison
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler::AddPrimitive(const G4Polymarker& polymarker):
  o Removed glEnable(GL_BLEND) and glBlendFunc(â€¦).  They are in 
    G4OpenGLViewer::InitializeGLView, which is, I think, all it needs.

9th October 2012  Laurent Garnier (opengl-V09-05-46, co-works interfaces-V09-05-19)
- G4OpenGLQtViewer/G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer/G4OpenGLImmediateQtViewer : 
  o Change mapping of context menu/icon in order to get all working together. 
    Now a click on an icon will change the mouse context menu.

7th October 2012  John Allison
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer::CompareForKernelVisit:
  o Added test of VisAttributesModifiers to list checked for kernel visit.

4nd October 2012  Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLQtViewer
  o Changing color on non touchables now ok (except text)
  o In DrawText, remove unnecessary (and wrong) glColor change
- G4OpenGLViewer
  o In DrawText, remove unnecessary (and wrong) glColor change
  o Use SetOrthogonalProjection/SetPerspectiveProjection/
    SetDefaultColour/SetDefaultTextColour instead of hard coded methods

3nd October 2012  Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLQtViewer :
  o Fix a bug when cloning scene tree in scene tree viewer (bad fix yesterday)
  o Change color for PO=-1 to "no color" instead of unspecified color

3rd October 2012  John Allison
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler, G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler::AddPrimitivePreamble,
  G4OpenGLStoredQtSceneHandler::ExtraPOProcessing:
  o Protected the case of G4LogicalVolumeModel.

2nd October 2012  Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLQtViewer : Fix a bug when cloning scene tree in scene tree viewer

2nd October 2012  John Allison
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer.cc:
  o Improved algorithm in DrawDisplayLists so that if the
    transparency if changed in DisplayTimePOColourModification,
    the drawing order is honoured immediately, i.e.,
    without needing a rebuild.  Objects are drawn in the
    following order:
    . Opaque;
    . Transparent;
    . Markers and polylines that are "not hidden".
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler:
  o Rationalised the recording of transparency in the PO/TO.  (It
    is not necessary to keep a separate flag for transparency; it
    is enough to inspect the alpha value of the colour.)

2nd October 2012  John Allison (opengl-V09-05-45)
- G4OpenGLStoredWin32Viewer.cc:
  o Re-add inclusion of missing header files on Win32

2nd October 2012  Laurent Garnier (opengl-V09-05-44)
- G4OpenGLStoredWin32.cc:
  o Re-add inclusion of missing header files on Win32

1st October 2012  John Allison (opengl-V09-05-43)
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer.cc:
  o Removed hidden marker from list of parameters that of changed trigger a
    kernel re-visit.  DisplayLists() can now cope with a change because the
    required information is in the PO/TO.

28th September 2012  Laurent Garnier (opengl-V09-05-42)
- G4OpenGLQtViewer:
  o Fixed compiler warning

28th September 2012  Gabriele Cosmo (opengl-V09-05-41)
- Explicitly include units header in G4OpenGLQtViewer.cc.

28th September 2012  Laurent Garnier (opengl-V09-05-40)
- G4OpenGLQtViewer:
  o Fixed compiler warning and remove dead code

27th September 2012  John Allison
- G4OpenGLImmediate/StoredSceneHandler.cc:
  o Fixed clang compiler warning.

27th September 2012  John Allison (opengl-V09-05-39)
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler:
  o Removed RequestPrimitives.  Previously, G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler had its
    own version of RequestPrimitives, which attempted to re-use a display list
    if the geometry object had been encountered earlier with a different
    transformation.  The transformation is kept in the PO and the display list
    is re-used.  One has to be careful about replicas and transformations.  Now
    this code has been moved to AddPrimitivePreAmble.

27th September 2012  John Allison (opengl-V09-05-38)
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler, 
  o Minor name changes to improve readability.
  o Added #include <typeinfo> to fix compiler warnings on Linux.
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer:
  o Fix to enable switching from hidden markers to non-hidden and transparent
    to opaque and v.v.
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler.cc:
  o Fix compiler warning on Linux.

27th September 2012  John Allison (opengl-V09-05-37)
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler, G4OpenGLImmediateSceneHandler, G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler,
  G4OpenGLStoredViewer:
  o Major re-design of scene and transient processing:
    . Three categories foreseen:
      ~ Opaque
      ~ To be treated as transparent
      ~ To be treated as non-hidden.  This applies to markers and polylines if
        hidden markers is _not_ requested, which is the default so that
        trajectories are always visible even if drawing in surface style.
        To change this - /vis/viewer/set/hiddenMarker true.
    . Thus G4OpenGLSceneHandler::ProcessScene() is three-pass-capable.
    . Also G4OpenGLStoredViewer::DrawDisplayLists makes three passes.
    . Appropriate information is stored in the PO or TO.

26th September 2012  Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLQtViewer : Remove all "ApplyCommand"

25th September 2012  John Allison (opengl-V09-05-36)
- Tagged for system testing.

25th September 2012  Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLQtViewer : Fix a bug with setting color when changing vis parameters 
  not taken in account

25th September 2012  John Allison (opengl-V09-05-35)
- G4OpenGLViewer:
  o Revert to previous version.  glColorMaterial now in G4OpenGLSceneHandler.
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler:
  o Uses glColorMaterial judiciously for wireframe and surface (hsr) drawing:
    . GL_FRONT_AND_BACK for transparent polyhedra;
    . GL_FRONT for opaque (since back surfaces always hidden).
  o However, use glMaterial as before for hidden edge (hlr and hlhsr).  Un-
    fortunately this means "temporary" changes of colour, such as may be obtained
    with the Qt viewer, are not respected.
- G4OpenGLImmediateSceneHandler, G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler, G4OpenGLStoredViewer:
  o Paid proper respect to transparency_enabled (default = true).  If true use
    glColor4d, else use glColor3d.

24th September 2012  John Allison (opengl-V09-05-34 - needs interfaces-V09-05-15)
- G4OpenGLImmediate/StoredQt.cc;
  o Checked instantiation of G4UIQt.
- G4OpenGLViewer::InitializeGLView:
    // Material (for surface rendering) follows glColor at all times.
    glColorMaterial(GL_FRONT_AND_BACK, GL_AMBIENT_AND_DIFFUSE);
    glEnable(GL_COLOR_MATERIAL);
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler.cc:
  o Commented out all uses of glMaterial.  Material now determined by glColor, since
    we now specify glColorMaterial - see G4OpenGLViewer::InitializeGLView.
  o Changed glColor3d to glColor4d.
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer.cc:
  o Changed glColor3d to glColor4d (except for "head time").
- G4OpenGLViewer, G4OpenGLQtViewer.cc, G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler, G4OpenGLXViewer.cc:
  o Changed glColor3d to glColor4d.

24th September 2012  John Allison (opengl-V09-05-33)
- Tidied headers and improved comments.

20th September Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLViewer.cc : Fix uninitialize value
- G4OpenGLQtViewer :
  o 10x faster when getting color or visibility on element
  o Avoid changing Vis Attributes when changing color on PO objects
  o Fix problem on close/expand sometimes when rebuilding the scene
  -> But last point means that the scene tree viewer is no longer working
  on changing color/transparency, will be fix in next commit

7th August 2012  Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLViewer : Fix layout problem on gl2ps text
- G4OpenGLXViewer : Typo

6th August 2012  John Allison  (opengl-V09-05-31)
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler and G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler:
  o Protected against null result of dynmic_cast on viewer (shouldn't happen!!).

5th August 2012  Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLQtViewer.cc, G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.cc
  o Fix default 43903 43943 ...
  o Fix potentiel compilation warning

5th August 2012  Laurent Garnier  (opengl-V09-05-30, coworks interfaces-V09-05-12)
- G4OpenGLImmediateQtViewer : Minor fix
- G4OpenGLQtViewer.cc :
  o Now take in account the GUI (interface package) icons status for move/rotate/pick
  o Move scene tree widgets into tab instead of VBox
  o Implement Zoom In/Out function, now it zoom on a specific point

11th August 2012 Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLQtViewer.cc/G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer: 
  o Remove /vis/viewer/select command when changing transparency
  o Fixed compilation warning
  o Beginning of removing /vis/geometry/set/colour commands

8th August 2012  John Allison  (opengl-V09-05-29)
- G4OpenGLQtViewer.cc: Fixed "unused parameter" warning.

8th August 2012  John Allison  (opengl-V09-05-28, coworks interfaces-V09-05-09)
- Tagged.

7th August 2012  John Allison
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler:
  o Moved colour from display list to PO so that a sub-class may
    modify through the new virtual function below.
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer:
  o Added virtual void DisplayTimePOColourModification
          (G4Colour&, size_t /*currentPOListIndex*/) {}
    so that a sub-class may modify the colur/transparency.  (If the
    transparency is modified the rendering may not be optimal since
    the order of rendering is determined at POList construction time.)

30th July 2012 Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLQtViewer.cc :
  o Add search widget in scene tree
  o Double click now allow to change color/transparency

23th July 2012 Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLQtViewer.cc :
  o Do not apply changes to other viewer when moving scene tree slider
  o Fix a problem on scene tree with non touchable volumes
 
19th July 2012  John Allison
- G4OpenGLStored/ImmediateSceneHandler.cc:
  o Disabled GL_DEPTH_TEST and GL_LIGHTING for 2D objects, but see...
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler.cc:
  o Disabled GL_DEPTH_TEST and GL_LIGHTING for 2D lines and markers.

17th July 2012  John Allison  (opengl-V09-05-27)
- Fix Linux compiler warnings.

17th July 2012 Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLQtViewer.cc :
 o Fix a problem with Scene tree on mix with some transparent and non physical
   volumes.
 o Moving transparency slider does now do not change non physical volume hidden/visible.
 o Sort item in scene tree

17th July 2012  John Allison  (opengl-V09-05-26, co-works interfaces-V09-05-08)
- Tagged.
- Included Laurent's fix for text layout.

17th July 2012 Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLQtViewer.cc :
 o Fix text alignement problem

16th July 2012 Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLQtViewer : 
 o Bug fix for transparent objects in scene tree
 o Bug fix when closing a viewer on scene tree
 o bug fix when playing with scene tree and active tab was an immediate viewer

16th July 2012  John Allison
- G4OpenGLXViewer::DrawText:
  o Removed glDisable (GL_DEPTH_TEST); glDisable (GL_LIGHTING).
  o Now 3D text is hidden, when appropiate, by volumes drawn in surface mode.
  o (The depth testing of 2D objects, including 2D text, is dealt with in
     the scene handler.)
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler::Begin/EndPrimitives2D:
  o Moved fProcessing2D to G4VSceneHandler.
  o Now may be used by all and any driver.

13th July 2012 Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLQtViewer : Updates in Scene tree viewer algorithm 
  (speedup and fix transparency bug of 11th July).

11th July 2012 Laurent Garnier  (opengl-V09-05-25 co-works interfaces-V09-05-08)
- G4OpenGLStoredQtSceneHandler.cc, G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer.cc : change/rename fonction
- G4OpenGLQtViewer : 
 o Change Scene tree viewer algorithm (still some bug in tree on transparent objects)
 o Move scene tree layout to "interfaces", this fix a "bad layout problem"
   some tags ago

5th July 2012  Gabriele Cosmo  (opengl-V09-05-24)
- Explicitly use inclusion of headers for system of units and physical
  constants, in plan to remove implicit inclusion from globals.hh.

3rd July 2012  John Allison  (opengl-V09-05-23)
- Fixed some Coverity warnings.

2nd July 2012  John Allison  (opengl-V09-05-22)
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer.cc:
  o Important bug-fix for non-display-list text (i.e., Qt).

27th June 2012  John Allison
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer.cc: Tidy.

18th June 2012  John Allison  (opengl-V09-05-21)
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer::DrawDisplayLists:
  o For special case of text that must be treated without a display
    list, call G4OpenGLSceneHandler::AddPrimitive(const G4Text&)
    directly and call glPushMatrix, glColor, etc., as would be in the
    display list.
  o Remove code that changed fMemoryForDisplayLists (was a bad idea!!).

16th June 2012  John Allison  (opengl-V09-05-20)
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler::AddPrimitivePreamble:
  o Re-instated glDrawBuffer(GL_FRONT) when memory for display lists is
    unavailable.  It now draws further trajectories properly.
- G4OpenGLStoredX(m)Viewer::ShowView:
  o Removed functions altogether, so parent class functions are now used.
  o They were issuing an extra Clear/DrawView.
  o ShowView is invoked at end of run and was thus causing an
    unneccessary draw.
  o It also had the effect of losing the above-mentioned "further
    trajectories" at the end of run.

16th June 2012  John Allison  (opengl-V09-05-19)
- Added /vis/ogl/set/eventsDrawInterval.
  o By default, the screen is updated at the end of every event.
    Allowing OpenGL to buffer several events can make a big
    improvement in drawing speed.  E.g., with exampleB1, 1000 events
    took 5 seconds but with "/vis/ogl/set/eventsDrawInterval 100",
    only 1 second.

15th June 2012  John Allison
- G4OpenGLImmediateSceneHandler:
  o Added ClearTransientStore, which issues Set/Clear/DrawView.
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.cc:
  o G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler::ClearTransientStore:
    Re-introduced Set/Clear/DrawView.

12th June 2012  Laurent Garnier  (opengl-V09-05-18)
- G4OpenGLQtMovieDialog.cc
  o Shadow clean.

8th June 2012  John Allison  (opengl-V09-05-17)
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler.cc, G4OpenGLXmSliderBar.cc,
  G4OpenGLStoredViewer.cc, G4OpenGLViewer.cc::
  o Shadow clean.
- G4OpenGLQtExportDialog.hh/cc, G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer.cc,
  G4OpenGLQtMovieDialog.cc, G4OpenGLQtViewer.cc,
  G4OpenGLImmediateQtViewer.cc:
  o Clean all possible shadows, but many remain because Q_OBJECT,
    qobject.h, qdialog.h, qgl.h and others use "s" and/or "sr".

29th May 2012  John Allison  (opengl-V09-05-16)
- G4OpenGLStoredQtSceneHandler.cc:
  o Reverted to opengl-V09-05-14 (r58177).
- Implemented proper treatment of transparency in OpenGL stored mode
  in the case that trajectories passed through or behind transparent
  persistent objects (detector components).  Required proper ordering
  of display list execution. 
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer::DrawDisplayLists:
  o Now does two passes for a proper treatment of transparency.
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler:
  o Added fDisplayOnSecondPassForTransparency to PO and TO.
- G4OpenGL(Immediate/Stored)SceneHandler:
  o Improved name - fSecondPassForTransparency, etc., instead of fSecondPass.

23rd May 2012  John Allison  (opengl-V09-05-15)
- Health Check 2012: Migrated (see management/History):
  o G4OpenGLSceneHandler: Added
      void G4OpenGLSceneHandler::ProcessScene()
      {
        G4VSceneHandler::ProcessScene();
        // Repeat if required...
        if (fSecondPassRequested) {
          fSecondPass = true;
          G4VSceneHandler::ProcessScene();
          fSecondPass = false;
          fSecondPassRequested = false;
        }
      }
  o G4OpenGLSceneHandler.cc:
    . Changed glDepthFunc (GL_LESS) to glDepthFunc (GL_LEQUAL) for
      hidden polylines and markers.
    . Changed glDepthMask (0/1) to glDepthMask (GL_FALSE/TRUE).
  o G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.cc, G4OpenGLStoredQtSceneHandler.cc:
    . Removed calls to G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler::ClearTransientStore and
      G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler::ClearStore.
    . Removed calls to Set/Clear/DrawView.
  o G4OpenGLImmediateSceneHandler:
    . Removed ClearTransientStore.
  o G4OpenGLStoredXViewer.cc:
    . Tidied.

  o Cleaned up display list drawing.  If special text (G4TextPlus), do
    not push, mult and pop matrix here (it is done in G4VScenehandler
    when it is re-used for text).
  o No need for transform in G4TextPlus.

14th February 2012  John Allison  (opengl-V09-05-05)
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.cc:
  o Fixed bug in TO copy constructor.
  o This was causing text to be displayed in the wrong place.  Probably
    other transients too!!
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler.cc:
  o General tidy.
  o Several functions need to access data and/or methods in G4OpenGLViewer.
    static_cast doesn't work with a virtual base class, so use dynamic_cast.
    No need to test the outcome since viewer is guaranteed to be a
    G4OpenGLViewer.  Make usage consistent.
  o G4OpenGLSceneHandler::AddPrimitive (const G4Circle& text):
    . Removed glGetFloatv(GL_CURRENT_COLOR, color).
    . There is no need to save current colour; colour is defined for
      every primitive before drawing.

13th February 2012  John Allison  (opengl-V09-05-04)
- G4OpenGLStoredQtSceneHandler.cc: Added #include <typeinfo> for gcc 4.3.

4th February 2012  John Allison  (vis-V09-05-04-2ndbranch-opengl-04)
- Needs greps-V09-05-04 (G4Text copy constructor).
- PO/TOList: Changed G4TextModel* to G4Text*.

2nd February 2012  John Allison  (vis-V09-05-04-2ndbranch-opengl-03)
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.cc:
  o Removed glDrawBuffer(GL_FRONT) when no memory for display lists.
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer.cc:
  o Remove tempMFDL and associated code (see 1st February).The
    following renders it unnecessary.
  o When re-using AddPrimitive, by-pass the stored AddPrimitive to
    avoid making more display lists and other stuff in
    AddPrimitivePreamble, etc.  Use
      static_cast<G4OpenGLSceneHandler&>(fSceneHandler).
        G4OpenGLSceneHandler::AddPrimitive(...).
  o Fixes StoredQt text problem.

1st February 2012  John Allison  (vis-V09-05-04-2ndbranch-opengl-02)
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer::DrawDisplayLists:
  o Some systems, notably Qt, re-use model->DescribeYourselfTo(sceneHandler)
    but we don't want to create any further display lists, so...
      G4bool tempMFDL = fG4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.fMemoryForDisplayLists;
      fG4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.fMemoryForDisplayLists = false;
   ...and restore at the end.
  o However, back to square one... Text not drawn.  Why not?
    G4OpenGLQtViewer::DrawText get called so why doesn't it draw?
    (It seemed that without this fix, DescribeYourselfTo was creating
    a TO - again and again - and getting drawn that way.  But why
    does it not get drawn this way???)

31st January 2012  John Allison  (vis-V09-05-04-2ndbranch-opengl-01)
- G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer:
  o Removed DrawText, thereby allowing base class implementation
    G4OpenGLQtViewer::DrawText to operate.  Fixes text problem altogther!!

31st January 2012  John Allison  (vis-V09-05-04-2ndbranch-opengl-00)
- Special case text: skeleton.  Some systems, notabley Qt, process
  text in a special way; it cannot be stored in display lists.  So the
  text model pointer is stored in the PO/TO and processed separately.
  (PO = Persistent object, TO = transient object.)  The nested classes
  G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler::PO and TO keep relevent information,
  e.g., the display list index or, in this case, when relevant, a
  pointer to the G4TextModel.
  o G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler:
    . Added a G4TextModel* to PO and TO.
  o G4OpenGLStoredViewer::DrawDisplayLists:
    . If PO or TO has a G4TextModel*, DescribeYourselfTo(fSceneHandler).
  o G4OpenGLStoredQtSceneHandler::ExtraPO/TOProcessing:
    . Stores the G4TextModel pointer in the current PO/TO.
  o G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer::DrawText:
    . Added temporary print statement (prints text).

17th January 2012  Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLStoredQtSceneHandler : Add ProcessText method
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer : Remove DrawOutOfDisplayLists method (moved in G4OpenGLStoredViewerQt)
- G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer : Add DrawOutOfDisplayLists method
 
13th January 2012  John Allison (opengl-V09-05-02)
- Tagged.

3rd January 2012 Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer : add a method DrawOutOfDisplayLists () in order, for
  the moment, to be able to redraw text outside of display list
- G4OpenGLQtViewer : Remove unused method CreateFontLists()
- G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer : In ComputeView method, after DrawDisplayLists, now we call DrawOutOfDisplayLists in order to draw text. Also remove DrawText (only print a warning message)
- G4OpenGLViewer : Better information message
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler : Add text in store mode special case for Qt viewer.
  Exchange a GL_FRONT to GL_BACK drawing in the case of out of memory for display list

2nd January 2012  John Allison  (opengl-V09-05-01)
- G4OpenGLImmediate/StoredQt/X/Xm/Wt.hh:
  o Removed #ifdef G4VIS... protection from header files so that they
    can be used for a possible dynamic library.  Of course, the
    protection remains on the implementation files.

16th December 2011  John Allison  (opengl-V09-05-00)
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.cc:
  o Corrected treatment of colour for transient objects that got
    slightly mangled in the changes of 15th Decemeber.  Colour should
    *not* be in the display list since in some circumstances we modify
    it (fade by time).  Instead it is kept in the TO object.

15th December 2011  John Allison
- The following changes from vis-V09-04-11-branch:
27th October 2001 JA (on vis-V09-04-11-branch).
- Transferred LoadAtts to sub-classes.
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer.cc: Improved drawing loop.
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.hh:
  o Removed fAddPrimitivePreambleNestingDepth.  (Care in
    G4OpenGLSceneHandler means it is no longer needed.)
26th October 2001 JA (on vis-V09-04-11-branch).
- Minor changes and exposure of some debug statements.
25th October 2001 JA vis-V09-04-11-01 (on vis-V09-04-11-branch).
  o G4OpenGLSceneHandler:
    . Needs G4Polymarker::G4Polymarker (const G4VMarker&).
    . Reworked AddPrimitive for G4Polymarker, G4Circle and G4Square.
    . Instead of polymarker calling multiple circles/squares, circles
      and squares create a polymarker of size 1 and call polymarker.
    . Removed AddCircleSquare, AddCircleSquareVector and DrawXYPolygon.
  o G4OpenGLBitMapStore: Removed.
    . No longer needed.  Circles and squares are drawn as GL_POINTS.  (Why
      did I not notice this option before; would have saved a lot of trouble.)

4st November 2011  Laurent Garnier  (opengl-V09-04-15)
- Display message when using Text on Stored mode in Qt (problem not fixed)

27th October 2011  John Allison
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer.cc:
  o Unwrap PODLs (permanent object display lists, geometry volumes
    mainly).  Previously, the PODLs were called from a "top PODL".
    Instead, so that we can have control over which are drawn, they
    are called in a loop, like the TODLs (transient ODLs).  The is no
    measureable performance penalty, even on complex geometies.  (The
    top PODL still exists, but is not used; the corresponding code to
    call the top PODL is commented out.)
- G4OpenGLViewer.cc: Fix compilation warning.

- Tagged.

17th October 2011  Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLXmViewer :
  o Fix null pointer when open Panning panel.
  o Add a UpdateControlPanel method

16th October 2011  John Allison
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.cc:
  o Moved
      if (fReadyForTransients) glDrawBuffer (GL_FRONT);
    from AddPrimitivePreamble to BeginPrimitives and
      ScaledFlush();
      glDrawBuffer (GL_BACK);
    from AddPrimitivePostamble to EndPrimitives.  The number of calls
    to glDrawBuffer and number of (scaled) flushes is reduced, i.e.,
    once per bunch of primitives instead of every primitive.

15th October 2011  John Allison (opengl-V09-04-12)
- G4OpenGLStoredXViewer, G4OpenGLStoredXmViewer:
  o Added ClearView (see note on 13th October re non-appearence of
    trajectories).
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.cc:
  o Move ScaledFlush back to AddPrimitivePostamble (see note of 13th Oct).
    This addresses the problem of seeing trajectories in real time
    as generated.  I was wrong to move it to EndPrimitives.  It has
    to be done on the front buffer, before switching back to the
    back buffer, so it has to be done for each primitive.  But now it's
    scaled, that's not a problem.

14th October 2011  Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLXmViewer : Implement ResetView method, move some parameters
  into .hh files. Call ResetView at beggining to set parameters

13th October 2011  John Allison
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler: 
  o Introduced ScaledFlush to flush after every 100 primitives.
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler:
  o Re-engineered to use ScaledFlush in EndPrimitives.  It was in
    AddPrimitivePostamble, i.e, it was getting a flush after each
    primitive, which is more often than necessary.  The flush should
    have been after each bunch of primitives, i.e., in EndPrimitives.
    (I think this is why drawing slowed down a couple of years ago.)
    Even so, a flush would happen too often, so it is scaled.
- G4OpenGLImmediateSceneHandler:
  o Use ScaledFlush in EndPrimitives.
- G4OpenGLStoredXViewer, G4OpenGLStoredXmViewer:
  o Implement ShowView, which calls DrawView, to handle non appearence
    of trajectories on some X servers, particularly Mac XQuartz.
    Re-visit this at some future date.

11th October 2011  John Allison
- G4OpenGLViewer::ResetView: Invoke G4VViewer::ResetView.
- Fix G4OpenGLXmViewer::get_boolean_userData (mask lower 16 bits).

11th Octobre 2011 Laurent Garnier

22th September 2011  Laurent Garnier
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler : Add a parameter to wait until 100 lists generate until do a
  glFlush.  glFlush take about 90% time in store mode, divide glFluch  number by 100 will
  change the first vis time from 100% to 10+90/100 = 10,9%

20th September 2011  John Allison
- Fix transparency problem:
  G4OpenGLImmediateXViewer.cc, G4OpenGLStoredXViewer.cc,
  G4OpenGLImmediateXmViewer.cc, G4OpenGLStoredXmViewer.cc,
  G4OpenGLImmediateQtViewer.cc, G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer.cc,
  G4OpenGLViewer.cc:
  Move initial gl commands to G4OpenGLViewer::InitializeGLView,
  which is called from each particular viewer's Initialise or, in
  the case of G4OpenGLImmediate/StoredQtViewer::initializeGL, from Qt
  at initialisation.  This includes the following commands relevant to
  transparency, so they are now uniformly invoked for all viewers.
    glEnable (GL_BLEND);
    glBlendFunc (GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);

17th September 2011  John Allison
- G4OpenGLQtViewer:

  // Make sure screen corresponds to graphical database...
  if (fpViewer) {
    fpViewer -> SetView ();
    fpViewer -> ClearView ();
    fpViewer -> DrawView ();
  }
  I was wrong - it *is* necessary.  If not there, events are not refreshed.
  So this and similar changes below are all back to geant4-09-03, including
  glFlush, which is still a big performance penalty on Mac's Snow Leopard.

3rd June 2010  John Allison  (opengl-V09-03-05)
- Restored following files to geant4-09-03 in interests of stable behaviour:
  o G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.cc
    Restored code removed in opengl-V09-03-03:
  // Make sure screen corresponds to graphical database...
  if (fpViewer) {
    fpViewer -> SetView ();
    fpViewer -> ClearView ();
    fpViewer -> DrawView ();
  }
  o G4OpenGLStoredXViewer.cc:
    Restore to geant4-09-03.  Restored code removed in opengl-V09-03-03:
      } else { // ADD TO AVOID KernelVisit=1 and nothing to display
        DrawDisplayLists ();
        FinishView ();
- Note: G4OpenGLImmediateSceneHandler: Same code commented out.  I think
  it's not necessary for immediate mode.

30th May 2010  John Allison  (opengl-V09-03-04)
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler: Added AddCompound(const G4VDigi&).

29th May 2010  John Allison  (opengl-V09-03-03)

  if (fpViewer) {
    fpViewer -> SetView ();
    fpViewer -> ClearView ();
    fpViewer -> DrawView ();
  }
- G4OpenGLStoredXViewer.cc:
  Commented out as follows in DrawView (was causing extra buffer swap,
  thus showing bad picture; can't recall why it was introduced):
      } else { // ADD TO AVOID KernelVisit=1 and nothing to display
        //DrawDisplayLists ();  ????????? (JA)

4th April 2007  John Allison  (opengl-V08-02-05 - needs visman-V08-02-04)
- Implemented picking for OGLSX ( as well as OGLIX).  Hopefully works
  for OGL*Win32.  Still doesn't work for OGL*Xm.

3rd April 2007  John Allison  (opengl-V08-02-04 - needs visman-V08-02-03)
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler:
  o Re-organised display lists on a per-primitive basis, i.e., one
    display list per primitive.  (This is so that, except for text,
    the colour - or, rather, intensity - can be brought out of the
    display list into the TOList (Transient Object List) and
    controlled for the Display-by-Time feature.  Previously, if more
    than one primitive were drawn between BeginPrimitives and
    EndPrimitives, it would finish up all in one display list, colour
    commands included. Rationalises and fixes a rare bug in the
    Display-by-Time feature - see August 2006.)
  o Added AddPrimitive(const G4Polymarker&) so that it is treated as
    one primoitive to fit with the above re-organisation.
- Implemented picking for OGLIX.

25th March 2007  John Allison  (opengl-V08-02-03)
- Fix compiler warnings.

  .but not switched back.  Not serious, because context was always set
  before normal drawing.)

9th January 2007  John Allison  (opengl-V08-02-01)
- Implemented bitmap markers for MarkerSizeType == screen.  (The old
  polygon implementation remains for MarkerSizeType == world.)
- Added G4OpenGLBitMapStore to assist the above.
- G4OpenGLXViewer::CreateGLXContext:
  o Bug fix: Added missing break in colormap lookup routine.

5th January 2007  John Allison  (opengl-V08-02-00)
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler.cc:

- Fixed compiler warnings.

1st November 2006  John Allison  (opengl-V08-01-08)
- Replace /vis/oglx/set/printEPS by /vis/oglx/printEPS.  The new command
  actually initiates a print, rather than set a flag for printing.

24th October 2006  John Allison  (opengl-V08-01-07)
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer.cc: Calculate light front horizon properly.

30th August 2006  John Allison  (opengl-V08-01-04)
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler:
  o Implemented line width.
  o Switched off back face culling when clipping so that the inside of
    volumes can be seen.
  o Added CreateSection/CutawayPolyhedron to exploit generic
    sectioning (DCUT) and cutaways.  Currently not activated due to
    instabilities in BooleanProcessor.  Local sectioning still active
    but broken (at least on Mac) due to apparent change in effect of
    clipping planes (polyhedron edges not reconstructed).
  o Rationalised calculation of marker size.
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler:
  o Fixed bug due to recursive calls of AddPrimitive (polymarkers -> markers).
  o Pick up time range from G4VisAttributes.
- G4OpenGLViewer(Messenger):
  o Added position and colour to /vis/ogl/set/displayHeadTime.
  o Added /vis/ogl/set/displayLightFront.
- G4OpenGLStoredViewer.cc:
  o Rationalised CompareForKernelVisit.  (Local sectioning still active.)

  trajectory models.  Time is communicated via G4AttValues.
- Added G4OpenGLViewerMessenger.
- Added /vis/ogl/set/startTime and endTime of displayed objects.
- All factories: Instantiated G4OpenGLViewerMessenger.
- G4OpenGLViewer: Added fStart/EndTime.
- G4OpenGLXViewer.cc: Graceful recovery from unexpected tokens in
  spewPrimitiveEPS and spewSortedFeedback.

17th July  John Allison  (opengl-V08-01-01)
- Added /vis/oglx/set/printEPS (prints eps file on every update).

3rd July 2006  John Allison  (opengl-V08-01-00)
- Elimination of redundant variable doublebuffer and implementation of
  FinishView in all viewers.

30th May 2006  Joseph Perl  (opengl-V08-00-08)
- G4OpenGLImmediateWin32Viewer: Removed tests on doublebuffer since that
  variable seems to have random behavior and should be assumed false for
  this viewer.

29th May 2006  Joseph Perl  (opengl-V08-00-07)
- G4OpenGLWin32Viewer, G4OpenGLImmediateWin32Viewer, G4OpenGLStoredWin32Viewer:
  Removed common FinishView and instead made separate FinishView for the two different
  versions of this viewer since each wants a different buffer swapping behaviour.

12th May 2006  John Allison  (opengl-V08-00-06)
- G4OpenGLWin32Viewer: Fixed buffer swapping behaviour.

28th April 2006  John Allison  (opengl-V08-00-05 - needs visman-V08-00-14)

- G4OpenGLSceneHandler, G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler and
  G4OpenGLImmediateSceneHandler:
  o Implemented Begin/EndPrimitives2D (needs visman-V08-00-12 and
    greps-V08-00-02).
  o Migrated to direct access to G4PhysicalVolumeModel.
- G4OpenGLStoredX/Xm/Win32Viewer.cc: bug fix for conditional drawing
  of display lists in DrawView.

14th March 2006  John Allison  (opengl-V08-00-02)
- Refined display list building and re-drawing algorithm.
  o G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler::EndModeling: Changed to GL_COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE.
  o Avoided unnecessary re-execution in DrawView (X, Xm and Win32).
- G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler::RequestPrimitives: Refined display list
  re-use algorithm.  In test19 with global culling off, numbers of
  display lists used are:
  o 191  No re-use:
  o  73  Before this change: re-use except replicas (includes parameterised).
  o  33  After this change: re-use except parameterised and replicas in radius.

  o Set flag so SetView will not be called in ProcessView.
  o Leave background colour to ClearView.
- Used dynamic_cast<G4OpenGLViewer*>, no need for G4OpenGLViewerDataStore.
- G4OpenGLXmViewerMessenger: Made a smart singleton; interrogates vis manager
  for current viewer.

24th November 2005  John Allison  (opengl-V07-01-09)

5th September 2005  John Allison  (opengl-V07-01-03)
- Bug fix: stored transparent objects were being lost.

2nd September 2005  John Allison  (opengl-V07-01-02 - needs visman-V07-01-01)
- Bug fix: edgeflags problem introduced with smooth shading in
  opengl-V07-01-00.
- Implementation of a "better algorithm" for the rendering of
  transparent polyhedron objects.  It renders all opaque objects
  first, then renders the transparent objects with the depth buffer in
  read-only mode (see OpenGL Programming Guide).  It uses the new
  facility in G4VSceneHandler::ProcessScene for an optional second pass
  of the run-duration models in the scene.  Note this algorithm is
  still only an approximation.  It will still give the wrong blended
  colour if two transparent objects are rendered front first.  For
  nested transparent objects, this is unfortunate, because
  G4PhysicalVolumeModel traverses Geant4's mother-daughter hierarchy
  in such a way that mothers come first.  Also, there is no guaranteed
  relationship between the order of rendering and the depth of two
  transparent objects if they are at the same level or in different
  branches of the hierarchy.  Still, the only error will be an
  incorrect colour - the objects will still give the appearance of
  transparency, so it's a pretty good algorithm.  (An even better
  algorithm would be to attempt to render the facets in depth order,
  deepest first.  But how do you calculate the depth - centre of area,
  deepest corner?  One can still imagine pathalogical cases that would
  sometimes give the wrong colour.  Also, for stored mode, the order
  is fixed in a display list so when the user rotates the view, one
  would lose the depth ordering.  I think we have to accept that
  blending in OpenGL is only ever an approximation.  For accurate
  blending, use RayTracer.)

28th August 2005  John Allison  (opengl-V07-01-01)
- Half-way implementation of rendering of transparent polyhedron
  objects.  In this implementation, no account is taken of the order
  of rendering.  Transparent objects are rendered with depth testing
  off so that objects behind can still be seen.  But this means that
  opaque objects in front do not obscure them - and they jolly well
  should!  A better algorithm is to render all opaque objects first,
  then render the transparent objects with the depth buffer in
  read-only mode (see OpenGL Programming Guide).  This is going to
  take a little more thought - see opengl-V07-01-02.

20th July 2005  John Allison  (opengl-V07-01-00)
- Introduced smooth shading, taking advantage of hitherto un-noticed
  feature of HepPolyhedron::GetNextFacet that calculates the normals
  at each vertex so that curved surfaces are rendered more
  realistically (Gouraud shading).
- G4OpenGLImmediateSceneHandler.cc: Removed unnecessary #include's.
- G4OpenGLXmViewer.cc: Fixed to use window size hints.  This changes
  the default window size.  It used to be 400x400, hardcoded in
  G4OpenGLXmViewer.cc, but now it picks up the
  G4ViewParameters::GetWindowSizeHintX/Y, which defaults to 600x600.
  The user may change it on the command line, e.g:
    /vis/open OGLSXm 500
  or
    /vis/viewer/create ! ! 500

30th May 2005  John Allison  (opengl-V07-00-03)
- Fixed compilation problem in OpenGL on SUN.  (Replaced multimap by
  map of vectors in G4OpenGLFontBaseStore.)

4th May 2005  John Allison  (opengl-V07-00-02)
- Restored sequence Set/Clear/DrawView in ClearTransientStore.  (It
  was taken out to prevent recursive calling, but that seems to be OK,
  and it is needed to implement refresh at end of event/run.)

22nd April 2005  John Allison  (opengl-V07-00-01)
- Rationalised work of opengl-V07-00-00.  Functionality unchanged.
  o G4OpenGLViewer.hh: Created virtual void CreateFontLists(){}.
  o In all concrete viewers, added call to CreateFontLists().
  o Moved font code for X to G4OpenGLXViewer::CreateFontLists().
  o There is no longer a need to implement in the XmViewer, since it
    now inherits.  Thus the font code now only appears once for X.
  o Awaiting implementation for WIN32.

17th April 2005  John Allison  (opengl-V07-00-00)
- Based on vis-V07-00-13.
- Implemented text for X-Windows viewers.  Uses glXUseXFont, which
  creates display lists for nominated fonts.  Simple-minded scheme in
  which each viewer creates its own font display lists for a variety
  of sizes, which are accessed by the scene handler through a new
  class, G4OpenGLFontBaseStore.  Affected methods:
    G4OpenGLXViewer::CreateMainWindow()
    G4OpenGLXmViewer::CreateMainWindow()
    G4OpenGLSceneHandler::AddPrimitive (const G4Text& text)

18th November 2004  John Allison  (opengl-V06-02-07)
- Removed redundant fLastVP from G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.

15th November 2004  Guy Barrand
- G4OpenGLWin32Viewer::ShowView : glFlush was not sufficient 
  to see trajectories (for example with N03). Correct so that
  ShowView do a FinishView that does : glFlush, wglSwapBuffer
  and empty the Windows message queue.

22nd September 2004  John Allison  (opengl-V06-02-06)
- doxygen output to tmp area.
- Trap non-regular polyhedrons.

13th September 2004  Gabriele Cosmo  (opengl-V06-02-05)
- G4OpenGLTransform3D.cc: simplified implementation for GetMatrix()
  to allow for porting on CLHEP-1.9.X series.

23rd July 2004  John Allison
- Draws auxiliary edges if required.
- Added auxiliary edge button.

16th July 2004  John Allison  (opengl-V06-02-04)
- Refinements to hidden line, hidden surface removal.

14th July 2004  John Allison  (opengl-V06-02-03)
- Removed superfluous #include "G4VisManager.hh" from G4OpenGLXmViewer.cc.

13th July 2004  John Allison  (opengl-V06-02-02)
- Hidden line *and* hidden surface removal now works.

9th July 2004  John Allison  (opengl-V06-02-01)
- Fixed long-standing problem with hidden line removal.
- Improved messages on failure to get visual.
- Added GLX_STENCIL_SIZE explicit request to visual attributes - most
  systems provided by default anyway, so no effect.

1st July 2004  John Allison  (opengl-V06-02-00)
- Rationalised G4OpenGLSceneHandler ready for hidden line removal.
- Bug fix in G4OpenGLXmPanningCallbacks.cc for dolly control.

18th June 2004  Gunter Folger (geant4-06-02)
9th June 2004  Gabriele Cosmo  (vis-V06-01-03)
7th June 2004  Gabriele Cosmo  (vis-V06-01-02)
- GNUmakefile and disclaimer changes - see visualization/History.

9th April 2004  John Allison  (vis-V06-01-01 + interfaces-V06-01-00)
- Tagged OpenGL as below.  Joint with interfaces-V06-01-00.

7th April 2004  Guy Barrand
- visualization/OpenGL/* : use the G4OpenGL.hh file.
- Added : visualization/OpenGL/include/G4OpenGL.hh to encapsulate
  the include of gl/gl.h and gl/glu.h that may be platform dependant.
  It permits to rm some #ifdef WIN32 spread in the code. It opens also
  the way to the usage of the Apple OpenGL on a Mac.

17th February 2004  John Allison  (opengl-V06-00-00)
- Fixed bug #581: wrong order of statements in
  G4OpenGLXViewer::~G4OpenGLXViewer (see bug report).

4th October 2003  Gabriele Cosmo  (vis-V05-02-01)
- GNUmakefile:
  o replaced "digits+hits" with "digits_hits".
- Coworks with "geometry-V05-02-00" and "digits_hits-V05-02-00".

22nd September 2003  John Allison  (vis-V05-02-00, greps-V05-02-00)
- Cosmetic change to regularise names:
  o changed _Feedback3Dcolo to G4OpenGLXViewerFeedback3Dcolor.
  o changed _DepthIndex to G4OpenGLXViewerDepthIndex.

23rd June 2003  Guy Barrand  (opengl-V05-01-02)
- Commit a first implementation of G4OpenGLWin32Viewer.

10th June 2003  Gabriele Cosmo  (opengl-V05-01-01)
- More fixes for warnings in viewers classes.
- Added inclusion of <windows.h> for WIN32 platforms when GL headers
  are included.

05th June 2003  Gabriele Cosmo  (opengl-V05-01-00)
- Fixes for porting compilation on WIN32:
  o G4OpenGLWin32Viewer[.hh.cc]: removed inclusion of <GL/glx.h>.
  o G4OpenGLViewer.cc: replaced local variables near/far with pnear/pfar
    since declared 'obsolete' in WIN32 platforms.

27th November 2002  John Allison  (vis-V04-01-08)
- Improved algorithm of CompareForKernelVisit.

11th November 2002  John Allison  (opengl-V04-01-02)
- Corrected inclusion of G4OpenGLXViewer #ifdef X_DRIVER.
- Added G4OpenGLSceneHandler::AddThis for trajectories and hits - simply
  call default but there as a marker and encourager.
- Added tracking and digits+hits/hits to GNUmakefile.

16th October 2002  John Allison  (opengl-V04-01-01)
- Fix for WIN32.  Now compiles but viewer not implemented.

24th June 2002  John Allison  (opengl-V04-01-00)
- Further cosmetic changes in G4OpenGLXViewer.cc for DEC compiler.

10th June 2002  John Allison  (opengl-V04-00-03)
- Cosmetic changes for SUN-CC in G4OpenGLXmConvenienceRoutines.cc.

6th June 2002  John Allison  (opengl-V04-00-02)
- Cosmetic changes for GNU compiler in G4OpenGLXViewer.cc.

23rd February 2002  John Allison  (opengl-V04-00-01)
- Changes to encourage compilation on Windows in preparation for
  implementation of G4OpenGLWin32Viewer.  Removed spurious includes of
  glx.h, unistd.h and assert.h.

24th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-13)
- Limited the printing of warnings in
  G4OpenGLSceneHandler::AddPrimitive (const G4Text& text).

14th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-11)
- Improved KernelVisitDecision.
- Fixed a few small bugs in multiple "stored" viewers, but see next item.
- There's an outstanding bug in OpenGL Stored.  If there is more than
  one viewer controlled by a scene handler, after a ClearStore on the
  scene handler, e.g., with /vis/scene/notifyHandlers, the first
  viewer to get refreshed should trigger the display list rebuild, but
  the second need not.  However, when the second viewer's turn comes,
  the display lists are there, and are called, e.g.,
  G4OpenGLStoredXViewer::DrawView calls
  G4OpenGLStoredViewer::DrawDisplayLists that calls glCallList, but
  nothing appears on the screen.  To overcome this there is some
  temporary code in G4VViewer::NeedKernelVisit which marks *all*
  viewers to force a rebuild.  To see the symptoms, comment out that
  temporary code and issue these commands:
    /vis/verbose c
    /control/verbose 2
    /vis/scene/create
    /vis/scene/add/volume
    /vis/sceneHandler/create OGLSX
    /vis/viewer/create ! ! 1
    /run/beamOn
    /vis/viewer/create ! ! 1
    /vis/viewer/select viewer-0
    /vis/viewer/viewpointThetaPhi 20 20
    /vis/viewer/select viewer-1
    /vis/viewer/viewpointThetaPhi 40 40
    /vis/viewer/set/style surface
    /vis/viewer/refresh
    /vis/viewer/select viewer-0
    /vis/viewer/refresh
    /vis/viewer/select viewer-1
    /vis/viewer/set/style wireframe
    /vis/scene/notifyHandlers
  You may have to do this too:
    /vis/viewer/select viewer-0
    /vis/scene/notifyHandlers
  One of the viewers is empty.  Curious!!

9th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-10-00)
- Implemented G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler::ClearTransientStore()
- Removed G4OpenGLSceneHandler::AddPrimitive (const G4Polymarker&) (it only
  invoked G4VSceneHandler::AddPrimitive (const G4Polymarker&) which is
  picked up by inheritance anyway.
- Removed lots of unnecessary header files from G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler.cc.
- Corrected order of calling base class functions in
  G4OpenGLStoredSceneHandler::Begin/EndModeling.

24th July 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-06)
- G4OpenGLSceneHandler::AddPrimitive (const G4Text&) handles transformation.

14th July 2001  John Allison (opengl-V03-02-00)
- Fixed crash in optimised mode: added Initialise() to viewers so
  that windows are opened after viewers are fully constructed.

2nd April 2001  John Allison (opengl-V03-00-01 wrt vis-V03-00-09)
- Tidied G4OpenGLXmViewer callback code.  Removed superfluous header files.

7th March 2001  John Allison
- Changed char* to const char* in many places and that gave problems in
  calls to Xt and Xm.  Hope all's OK.  Differences:
    cvs diff -r vis-V03-00-06 vis-V03-00-07

25th January 2001  John Allison  (opengl-V03-00-00)
- Implemented running re-calculation of up-vector in the case of "object
  rotation" (lights move with camera) to prevent "flipping" of view when
  camera passes through up-vector.  Note that the default is "camera
  rotation" (lights do not move with camera, i.e., remain fixed relative
  to object) so the default is that this "flipping" can happen.  To set
  "object rotation" (lights move with camera) use
  /vis/lights/move_with_camera true (soon to be
  /vis/viewer/set/lights move-with-camera) or click "Object" radio button
  on Rotation Panel in OpenGLXm mode.
- Changed some objects to references for efficiency.  E.g.:
  const G4Vector3D& vp = pView->fVP.GetViewpointDirection ().unit ();

22nd May 2000  John Allison  (opengl-V01-01-00)
- Fixed slow response of 2nd window of OpenGLXm.  Worked around Mesa bug
  by sharing static visuals in G4OpenGLXViewer (Guy Barrand):
    static XVisualInfo* vi_single_buffer;
    static XVisualInfo* vi_double_buffer;
- Removed ChooseVisual from G4OpenGLXmViewer.cc - done in base class
  G4OpenGLXViewer.
- Protected double deletion of window in destructors of G4OpenGLXmViewer
  and G4OpenGLXViewer (Guy Barrand).
- Changed requested bits per colour to r,g,b = 1,1,1 in G4OpenGLViewer.cc.
- Corrected order of CreateMainWindow() and InitializeGLView() in X*Viewer
  constructors.
