    transformation if LV and PV pointers are zero.
  o G4OpenInventorSceneHandler::PreAddSolid: Added code to pick up
    colour if LV and PV pointers are zero and removed return statement
    so that transformation is picked up too.

30th November 2005  Gabriele Cosmo (openinventor-V07-01-04)
- Trivial fix to SoPolyhedron for support of CLHEP-2.0.X series.

15th November 2005  Guy Barrand (openinventor-V07-01-03)

- G4OpenInventorViewer : in "Scene graph stats", count triangles,lines,points.
- G4OpenInventorViewer : set auto refresh by default.

21th November 2004  Guy Barrand
- G4OpenInventor[Xt,Win]Viewer, SceneHandler : add a simple picking that
  dumps picked SoNode address, type and name.
- G4OpenInventor[Xt,Win]Viewer : "Help controls" menu item.
- G4OpenInventorSceneHandler::PreAddThis : comment the "ERROR leaf protocal"
  message. Misleading to users.

19th November 2004  Guy Barrand
- G4OpenInventorSceneHandler::ClearStore: clear the fSeparatorMap.

18th November 2004  Guy Barrand
- G4OpenInventorSceneHandler::PreAddThis : handle viewer style.
- G4OpenInventorView : have an SoOrthographicCamera
  and a first implementation of SetView.
- Removed redundant fLastVP from G4OpenInventorSceneHandler (JA).

17th November 2004  Guy Barrand
- G4OpenInventorSceneHandler : rm the AddThis(G4Box,....). We use
  then only the generic AddPrimitive(G4Polyhedron). Much simpler.

15th November 2004  Guy Barrand
- G4OpenInventorViewer : //FIXME comment out on 
  f[Default]VP.SetCulling(false) by default. Not convinced that it is
  the right thing to do.
- G4OpenInventorViewer : have f[Default]VP.SetCulling(false) by default.
- On viewer have "Erase detector, event" menuitems for Xt and Win.
- G4OpenInventorWinViewer : have it inheriting G4OpenInventorViewer.
- G4OpenInventorSceneHandler : WIN32 : correct some warnings.

14th November 2004  Guy Barrand
- G4OpenInventorSceneHandler.cc : handle transparency.
- SoImageWriter, SbPainter, SbPainterPS : material to produce pixmap PS.
- G4OpenInventorViewer : base class for Inventor viewers.
- Menuitem "Etc/Triangles" : to count rendered triangles.
- Menuitem "File/IV" : to write the scene in an inventor file.

14th November 2004  John Allison  (openinventor-V06-02-01)
- Tag on branch openinventor-V06-02-01-branch.
- Consolidating the changes below, plus:
  - forcing culling off by default;
  - forcing solid mode;
  so that the user:
  - sees all of the requested geometry volume tree;
  - can use pointer button and CTRL-left-click to uncover (SHIFT-left-click
    to re-cover);
  - can use the hand button and right-click to get wireframe.
- Removed G4OpenInventorSceneHandler::EndModeling (empty function).

12th November 2004  Guy Barrand
- G4OpenInventor.cc : initClass of Geant4_SoPolyhedron.
- G4OpenInventorWinViewer.cc : WM_COMMAND : filter only messages
  from the window viewer menu.
- G4OpenInventorSceneHandler.cc : rm G4Polymarker::line handling.

11th November 2004  Guy Barrand
- Add SoPolyhedron that permits to visualize directly HepPolyhedron.
- G4OpenInventorSceneHandler::AddThis : uses the generic
  SoPolyhedron. Modeling is wireFrame by default.
  Solid modeling is used only in case visAtb.SetForceSolid(true).
- G4OpenInventorSceneHandler::PreAddThis : correct a flaw
  in the non-leaf part ; in case mother not found in fSeparatorMap
  the SoDetectorTreeKit were added nowhere ! This induced that 
  exaN03Vis5 displayed no gemetry.
- SoStyleCache : permit to cache commonly used colors, line styles and
  light models.
- G4OpenInventorSceneHandler : use SoStyleCache to minimize number of nodes.
- End of the first world war. 
- Death of Arrafat.

10th November 2004  Guy Barrand
- SoMarkerSet, SoGL2PSAction : corrections to work with SGI Inventor.
- gl2ps : gl2psPrintPostScriptPixmap : fix nbit=2,4 width truncation. 
  (On SoMarkerSet, the last column of pixmapswere missing ).

9th November 2004  Guy Barrand
- WIN32 : G4OpenInventorWinViewer : have a File pulldown menu
  with an Escape button to quit secondary Windows event loops.
- Xt : G4OpenInventorXtViewer : in destructor comment (and //FIXME)
  the "delete fViewer". With SGI, it hangs.
- Xt : Have a menubar and put escape button in the File pulldown menu.
- SoGL2PSAction, gl2ps : action to handle PostScript production with gl2ps.
- Xt : "PostScript" menu item.
- WIN32 : "PostScript" menu item.

8th November 2004  Guy Barrand
- WIN32 : Have HEPVis/SbGL.h to access GL.h properly on Windows.
  Use by SoMarkerSet.cc.
- G4OpenInventor.cc : initialize SoMarkerSet.
- G4OpenInventorWinViewer : correct bad viewer look and feel.

7th November 2004  Guy Barrand
- Have SoMarkerSet.h, .cc in the repository.
- G4OpenInventorSceneHandler : 
  Have a AddPrimitive(G4Polymarker) using SoMarkerSet.
  SoMarkerSet draws markers in the frame buffer. It is much
  more performant than having SoSphere and SoCube for markers.

6th November 2004  Guy Barrand
- G4OpenInventorXtViewer : restore the escape button.
  This button is put in the "app buttons" of the SoXtExaminerViewer.
  (The "app buttons" are put in the left border of decoration).
  It is ok with SGI-2.1.510 and recent SoXt of Coin, 

21th July 2004  Guy Barrand (openinventor-V06-02-00)
- G4OpenInventorXtViewer : add include X11/Shell.h to have
  XtNgeometry that may not come throught the includes of some
  Inventor implementation.

08th April 2004  Guy Barrand (openinventor-V06-01-00)
- Bring in the repository the necessary HEPVis code. In fact few of HEPVis
  is used in this G4 driver. Then HEPVis is no more needed.
  Note that, to avoid clashes of G4/vis within experiments, the HEPVis
  node are protected by some : #define Geant4_<node> <node>.  Then, for
  example, within the G4OpenInventor lib there are Geant4_SoBox, etc...
  (and not SoBox,... that may clash with other HEPVis code in  experiments).
- Have code to run on Windows.
- Split Viewer to have G4OpenInventorXtViewer and G4OpenInventorWinViewer.
- Split G4OpenInventor to have G4OpenInventorXt and G4OpenInventorWin.
  Xt and Win (and not X and Win32 like in vis/OpenGL) to follow 
  the conventions found in the OpenInventor world.

29th October 2003  Cosmo Gabriele (openinventor-V05-02-00)
- Patch in G4OpenInventorSceneHandler in PreAddThis() to cope with changes
  introduced in G4VPhysicalVolume in "geant4-05-02-ref-04", where pointer to
  mother physical-volume was removed.
  Separators map now refers to logical-volumes and is no longer built
  iteratively for each call to the method as it was done in an attempt
  implemented previously.
  NOTE: requires more investigation and eventually a revision of the
        adopted algorithm.
- Cleared usage of 'NULL' in favour of '0'.

4th October 2003  Cosmo Gabriele (vis-V05-02-01)
- Simplified GNUmakefile.

14th January 2003  John Allison  (openinventor-V05-00-00)
- Removed vertex.transform (*fpObjectTransformation) from
  G4OpenInventorSceneHandler::AddPrimitive (const G4Polyhedron& polyhedron).
  Symptom was that polyhedron objects were being transformed twice.
  The transformation is stored in 
  G4OpenInventorSceneHandler::PreAddThis
  ...
  G4OpenInventorTransform3D oiTran (objectTransformation);
  SoSFMatrix* oiMat = oiTran.GetOIMatrix();
  SoMatrixTransform* xform = new SoMatrixTransform;
  xform->matrix.setValue(oiMat->getValue());
  currentSeparator->addChild(new SoResetTransform);
  currentSeparator->addChild(xform);
}

27th November 2002  John Allison  (vis-V04-01-08)
- Improved algorithm of CompareForKernelVisit.

14th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-11)
- Improved KernelVisitDecision - but see note therein.
