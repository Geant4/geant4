- G4endl ==> "\n" for fDest objects

VRML-V00-01-01 4th November 1999  Satoshi Tanaka
- Introduction of VRMLBeginModeling() for new vis commands

VRML-00-03-07	Satoshi TANAKA	Dec 07, 1998  
- An environmental variable "G4VRML_VIEWER" is renames to 
  "G4VRMLFILE_VIEWER" for consistency.

VRML-00-03-06	Satoshi TANAKA	Dec 04, 1998  
- Maximun number of generated g4.wrl files in the destination
  directory is customizable as: "setenv G4VRMLFILE_MAX_FILE_NUM  N"
  (N is the integer greater than or equal to 1. The default value is 1.)

VRML-00-03-04	Satoshi TANAKA	Dec 03, 1998  
- Bug fix of SetPVPickability();

VRML-00-03-03	Satoshi TANAKA	Nov 30, 1998  
- Destination directiory of g4.wrl and g4_X.wrl is customizable 
  with the environmental variable "G4VRMLFILE_DEST_DIR".

  Unix:
   % setenv G4VRMLFILE_DEST_DIR   directory_name/

   For example, 

   % setenv G4VRMLFILE_DEST_DIR   /tmp/

   Do not forget to add "/" at the end of the directory name.

  NT: 
   DOS> set G4VRMLFILE_DEST_DIR   directory_name\

   Do not forget to add "\" at the end of the directory name.

- Minor change in policy of automatic incremation of output VRML file:

  OLD way: g4.wrl, g4_2.wrl, .....           , g4_100.wrl
  NEW way: g4.wrl, g4_1.wrl, g4_2.wrl, ..... , g4_100.wrl

  Maximal number of files in one directory is restricted in order to 
  avoid explosion of your hard disk. The maximal number is hard-coded.
  You can revise is by editing enum's of G4VRML1FILEScene.hh and 
  G4VRML2FILESchene.hh

  Note that the incrementation is done as follows (pseudo codes)

    filename = "g4.wrl" // initialization

    while( filename already exists in the dest directory )
    {
	  increment filename
    }

  It means that if you delete file "g4.wrl" in the destination directory,
  the file name in the next generation is still g4.wrl.

  The JAVA application VRML/g4vrmlview/g4vrmlview.java 
  for network visualization is also updated.


VRML-00-03-02	Satoshi TANAKA	Nov 13, 1998  
- Code refinement of VRML 2.0 driver
- Pickability of Physical volume is controllable with 
  setenv G4VRML_PV_PICKABLE  1/0
- Nickname of VRML drivers are renames:
  (Old names were, e.g., "VRML1File")

  VRML1 file    : VRML1FILE
  VRML1 network : VRML1

  VRML2 file    : VRML2FILE
  VRML1 network : VRML2
