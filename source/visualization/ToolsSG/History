- sources.cmake, GNUmakefile: G4ToolsSGOffscreen .hh and .cc files.
- G4ToolsSGViewer.hh: handle ambient lightening.
- G4ToolsSGViewer.hh: for "write paper", handle zb_png, zb_jpeg formats.
- G4ToolsSGViewer.hh: correct fSGViewer->set_clear_color(). The passed "green" was... blue.

## 2022-09-06 Ben Morgan (vis_toolssg-V11-00-12)
- Address dependency inconsistencies reported by geant4_module_check

## 2022-05-18 Guy Barrand (vis_toolssg-V11-00-11)
- have "toolx" namespace for g4tools code related to "externals", then:
  - tools::[Qt,Windows,X11,Xt,sg::text_freetype] become toolx::[Qt,Windows,X11,Xt,sg::text_freetype].
  - and corresponding includes #include <tools/...> become #include <toolx/...>

## 2022-05-03 Ben Morgan (vis_toolssg-V11-00-10)
- Preliminary build support for Qt5 and Qt6

## 2022-04-13 Ben Morgan (vis_toolssg-V11-00-09)
- Add needed dependencies

## 2022-04-06 John Allison (vis_toolssg-V11-00-08)
- `G4ToolsSGSceneHandler.cc`:
  - void G4ToolsSGSceneHandler::AddPrimitive(const G4Polyhedron& polyhedron):
    - Comment out common line elimination - too expensive for a large
      polyhedron.
    - Maybe eliminate altogether in future?
    - Allow the graphics-reps utilities to optimise things like this.
  - Use StandardSpecialMeshRendering(mesh).
    - Of course, only if special mesh rendering is requested.

## 2022-03-22 Ben Morgan (vis_toolssg-V11-00-07)
- Use geant4_module_sources to add optional sources

## 2022-03-07 John Allison (vis_toolssg-V11-00-06)
- `G4ToolsSGSceneHandler`:
  - `AddPrimitive (const G4Polymarker& a_polymarker)`:
    - Define dots as a single pixel.
    - Use `GetMarkerSize(...)` for circles and squares.
  - `AddCompound(const G4Mesh& mesh)`:
    - For parameterised tetrahedron mesh, call default
      G4VSceneHandler::DrawTetMeshAsDots(mesh).
    - Tested on "ICRP145", a Geant4 application that we hope can become
      a Geant4 advanced example, downloaded from the supplementary material
      of Kim et al, ICRP, 2020. Adult mesh-type reference computational
      phantoms, ICRP Publication 145, Ann. ICRP 49(3).

## 2022-03-05 John Allison (vis_toolssg-V11-00-05)
- `G4ToolsSGSceneHandler::SetPlotterHistograms`:
  - Suppress /control/verbose messages for /analysis/*/get* commands.

## 2022-02-08 Ben Morgan (vis_toolssg-V11-00-04)
- Access G4VVisCommand::G4VisManager pointer through static function GetVisManager
  to prevent DLL issues on Windows.

## 2022-01-30 John Allison (vis_toolssg-V11-00-03)
- Co-works with visman-V11-00-05.
- G4ToolsSGViewer.hh:
  - G4ToolsSGViewer::SwitchToMasterThread:
    - At the moment, the ToolsSG viewer cannot draw trajectories *during* a run
      so in multithreading mode, so in this function we draw any events that
      have been kept by the vis manager. But we only need to do it if there are
      end-of-event models in the scene - this tag fixes that.
    - It fixes an issue where plots were being drawn twice.
- G4ToolsSGSceneHandler.cc:
  - G4ToolsSGSceneHandler::SetPlotterHistograms:
    - Add warning message if plot cannot be found:
```
G4ToolsSGSceneHandler::SetPlotterHistograms: cannot get histogram - maybe doesn't exist?
  Maybe this app does not do analysis at all?
```

## 2022-01-28 Ben Morgan (vis_toolssg-V11-00-02)
- Replace `geant4_global_library_target` with direct file inclusion and
  call to `geant4_add_category` to define library build from source modules.

## 2022-01-16 John Allison (vis_toolssg-V11-00-01)
- G4ToolsSGViewer::wheel_rotate:
  - Re-program wheel_rotate for perspective projection:
    - Takes into account the extent of the scene.
- Reactivate G4ToolsSGQtGLES::IsUISessionCompatible
  - Paves way for permitted instantiation of multiple TSG drivers.

## 2021-12-10 Ben Morgan (vis_toolssg-V11-00-00)
- Change to new Markdown History format

# History entries prior to 11.0

13 November 2021 - John Allison (vis_toolssg-V10-07-16)
- G4ToolsSGSceneHandler.cc: Bug fix:
  - In AddPrimitive, use preferred GetColour(a_polyline) instead of GetColour().
    - Similarly for a_polymarker and a_polyhedron.
    - If the vis attributes pointer is not up to date, GetColour() picks up
      the colour of the previous object!
      - GetColour() will probably be deprecated in future! It's use is
        misleading - see visman-V10-07-27.

12 November 2021 - Ben Morgan (vis_toolssg-V10-07-15)
- Retire G4VIS_... preprocessor symbols in toolkit build, only required
  by obsolete GNUmake system

8 November 2021 - Ben Morgan (vis_toolssg-V10-07-14)
- Retire G4UI/G4INTY_... preprocessor symbols in toolkit build, only required
  by obsolete GNUmake system

05 November 2021  Guy Barrand (vis_toolssg-V10-07-13)
- G4ToolsSGSceneHandler: SetPlotterHistograms(): revisit
  in order that, from an int histogram hid given by a user (and
  passed to a G4Plotter), the address of the tools::histo, managed by G4/analysis,
  is retrieved by using a /analysis/h/get command so that the
  histo is copied in a tools::sg::plottable managed by a tools::sg::plotter.
  This way of doing secures the relationship tools::sg::plotter, managed by G4/vis
  relative to the histo, managed by G4/analysis.
   This overall way of doing permits to have the commands:
     /vis/plotter/add/h1,h2
  managed back in G4/vis, and then avoids to instrument
  G4/examples and user code with the templated G4VisPlotMessenger
  which is no more needed.

03 November 2021  Guy Barrand (vis_toolssg-V10-07-12)
- G4ToolsSGSceneHandler: changes to deal with the changes
  in management/G4PlotterManager that handles a local list of styles.

25 October 2021  Guy Barrand  (vis_toolssg-V10-07-11)
- src/G4ToolsSGQtViewer.cc, sources.cmake: Linux: it permits to have cmake doing the
  "mocing" of G4ToolsSGQtViewer.hh. (Strangely not needed on my mac).
- include/G4ToolsSGQtViewer.hh: handle a Qt "destroy" signal/slot to properly
  delete the G4ToolsSGViewer from the G4ToolsSGSceneHandler in case a user
  delete the viewer QWidget in the G4UIQt tab container widget.
- include/G4ToolsSGViewer.hh: FinishView: handle the update of plotters
  (tools::sg::plots nodes) if any in the scene graph. Done by using
  fSGSceneHandler.TouchPlotters()
- remove G4ToolsSGExport.hh. Now done by using tools/sg/write_paper.
- G4ToolsSGSceneHandler.hh,.cc: have a /vis/tsg/plotter/printParameters. To
  print available style parameters of the tools::sg::plotter node.
- G4ToolsSGSceneHandler.hh,.cc: plotting logic. Mainly implement AddPrimitive(G4Plotter)
  by handling a tools::sg::plots node in the scene graph. Have code to attach histograms
  and setup styles

22 October 2021  Guy Barrand  (vis_toolssg-V10-07-10)
- ToolsSG/History: change vis_toolsg to vis_toolssg in tags.
- include/G4ToolsSGQtViewer.hh: remove ShowView, FinishView: the below modification
  permits to rely on the parent ShowView, FinishView. (No more need to have code
  to handle the "in tab" case).
- include/G4ToolsSGQtViewer.hh/Initialise: enforce a Qt show() to be able
  to retreive the true QGLWidget size at startup.
- include/G4ToolsSGQtViewer.hh: __APPLE__: implement a SetView to enforce a
    fVP.SetGlobalMarkerScale(2);
  so that 2D text have a similar size than other drivers and platforms.
- include/G4ToolsSGViewer.hh: handle a /vis/tsg/export command to
  produce "paper" output files.
- include/G4ToolsSGViewer.hh: ShowView calls FinishView.
- include/G4ToolsSGViewer.hh: handle a scene graph so that camera and lighting nodes
  belong to the viewer.
- G4ToolsSGSceneHandler.cc: AddPrimitives : use G4VSceneHandler::GetColour(), GetTextColour()
  instead of the viewer vis attributs ones.
- G4ToolsSGSceneHandler.hh,.cc: revisit the scene graph logic so that camera and lighting
  nodes be handled by G4ToolsSGViewer.

13 October 2021  Guy Barrand  (vis_toolssg-V10-07-09)
- Following g4tools-V10-07-07.
- for 2D text with freetype; have a mechanism to handle embedded fonts.
  Have the font lato_regular.ttf embedded in the C++ file:
    tools/sg/font/lato_regular_ttf
  The embedding of a .ttf file is done by using 'xxd -i' on a UNIX.
  With this in place, usage of the env variable TOOLS_FONT_PATH is no more
  needed for 2D freetype text to find the lato_regular font at run time.
- handle G4/vis lightening. Use a tools::sg::torche.
- for 2D: handle mouse resize of the viewer (Qt,Xt,X11,Windows).
- handle transparency. Cowork with modifs in:
    tools/sg[GL_viewer,atb_vertices,render_action]
- G4ToolsSGViewer, G4ToolsSGSceneHandler: revisit the scene graph organization
  to handle 2D text
- handle 2D graphics. Cowork with modifs in:
    tools/sg/[text_freetype_marker,text_hershey_marker] to avoid text squashing.
