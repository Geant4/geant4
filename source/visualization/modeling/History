History file for visualization/modeling
---------------------------------------

14th May 2017  John Allison (modeling-V10-03-07)
- G4GPSModel: Added user-selectable colour.

3rd May 2017  John Allison (modeling-V10-03-06)
- Needs event-V10-03-01.
- Completed G4GPSModel for visualisation of General Particle Source. Can
  be used with command /vis/scene/add/gps.

3rd May 2017  John Allison (modeling-V10-03-05)
- Added prototype/skeleton G4GPSModel.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel::Validate:
  o Check world pointer (can be null if geometry has been cleared/destroyed).

19th April 2017  John Allison (modeling-V10-03-01)
- Added G4ModelingParameters::PVPointerCopyNo.

9th December 2016  John Allison (modeling-V10-03-00)
- Coworks with visman-V10-03-00.
- G4MagneticFieldModel: Augmented to take lineSegmentsPerCircle.
  Default is 6 for rapid yet adequate drawing, but this my be changed
  with /vis/set/arrow3DLineSegmentsPerCircle.

3rd November 2016  John Allison (modeling-V10-02-17)
- G4ModelingParameters and G4PhysicalVolumeModel:
  Changed default number of line segments per circle from 24 to 72.

2nd November 2016  John Allison (modeling-V10-02-16)
- G4ArrowModel: Default lines per circle = 6.
  But... there is no way to change this at run time with a
  UI command.  The following commands would have to be augmented:
    /vis/scene/add/arrow
    /vis/scene/add/axes
    /vis/scene/add/magneticField
  or a new general command added such as
    /vis/set/arrowLineSegmentsPerCircle

29th September 2016  John Allison (modeling-V10-02-15)
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel:
  o Delayed creation of modifiedVisAtts so that not created at all
    if there are no vis attributes modifiers.
  o Added std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& os,
    const std::vector<G4PhysicalVolumeModel::G4PhysicalVolumeNodeID>& path)
  o Modified so path can be copied and pasted into
   /vis/set/touchable command:
    std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& os,
    const G4PhysicalVolumeModel::G4PhysicalVolumeNodeID& node)

19th September 2016  John Allison (modeling-V10-02-14)
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc:
  o Used static to ensure a plausible vis attributes pointer.
    Note: G4VSceneHandler::PreAddSolid requires a G4VisAttributes
    object, so we have to provide one - we choose the default
    G4VisAttributes if no other is specified.

19th September 2016  John Allison (modeling-V10-02-13)
- Moved Vis Attributes Modifiers (VAMs) back from G4ViewParameters,
  reversing modeling-V10-02-11.
- Reversed modeling-V10-02-12.

12th September 2016  John Allison (modeling-V10-02-12)
- G4ModelingParameters.cc:
  o Changed output of 
    std::ostream& operator <<
    (std::ostream& os, const G4ModelingParameters::PVNameCopyNoPath& path)
    to correspond to arguments of /vis/set/touchable.

11th September 2016  John Allison (modeling-V10-02-11)
- G4ModelingParameters:
  o Removed Vis Attributes Modifiers (VAMs).
  o VAMs are now entirely in G4ViewParameters and dealt with
    in G4VViewer::GetApplicableVisAttributes.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc: Removed VAM code.

8th September 2016  John Allison
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc: Commented out VAM code.

31st August 2016  John Allison (modeling-V10-02-10)
- Co-works greps-V10-02-05.
- G4PseudoScene.hh:
  o Added
      void AddSolid (const G4Orb&);
      void AddSolid (const G4Ellipsoid&);
    to conform to greps-V10-02-05.
  o Tidied.
- G4PhysicalVolumeMassScene:
  o Changed to inherit G4PseudoScene.
  o Changed AccrueMass to ProcessVolume to conform to G4PseudoScene.
  o Added
      void AddSolid (const G4Orb&);
      void AddSolid (const G4Ellipsoid&);
    to conform to greps-V10-02-05.
  o Tidied.

14th August 2016  John Allison  (modeling-V10-02-07)
- G4TrajectoriesModel::DescribeYourselfTo:
  o Return if run or event not found.

7th August 2016  John Allison  (modeling-V10-02-06 needs greps-V10-02-02)
- G4ModelingParameters:
  o Added changes in Vis Att Modifiers for new flag IsForceDrawingStyle.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel:
  o Takes account of new flag IsForceDrawingStyle.

20th July 2016  John Allison  (modeling-V10-02-05)
- Introduced drawing and filtering by encountered volume.  I.e.,
    /vis/modeling/trajectories/create/drawByEncounteredVolume
    /vis/filtering/trajectories/create/encounteredVolumeFilter
  and their associated commands.  They replace the TouchedVolume
  commands introduced in modeling-V10-02-02.

2nd May 2016  John Allison  (modeling-V10-02-04)
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc: Fixed gcc-6.1 warning.

5th April 2016  John Allison  (modeling-V10-02-03)
- G4TrajectoryDrawByOriginVolume.cc: Tidied #include statements.

15th February 2016  John Allison  (modeling-V10-02-02)
- Introduced drawing and filtering by touched volume.  I.e.,
    /vis/modeling/trajectories/create/drawByTouchedVolume
    /vis/filtering/trajectories/create/touchedVolumeFilter
  and their associated commands.  Note that this
  selects only by a single string, the physical volume name.  If there
  are more than one physical volumes with that name then any trajectory
  touching any one of those volumes will be selected.  If the user sets
  more than one physical volume name (by using the set command more than
  once) the trajectory will be selected if it touches either of those
  volumes and which of the attributes (e.g., colour) associated with
  those volumes is chosen is undefined, but one will be chosen.
  A more comprehensive facility would allow the user to select by
  touched touchable, i.e., by the full path and copy numbers of the
  physical volume - but that is a job for the future if a use case arises.
  o G4TrajectoryModelFactories.hh/cc:
    Added G4TrajectoryDrawByTouchedVolumeFactory.
  o G4TrajectoryFilterFactories.hh/cc:
    Added G4TrajectoryTouchedVolumeFilterFactory.
  o Added new files and classes:
    G4TrajectoryDrawByTouchedVolume.hh/cc
    G4TrajectoryTouchedVolumeFilter.hh/cc  
  o G4ModelColourMap.hh: Added new access function:
    const std::map<T, G4Colour>& GetBasicMap() const;
    to allow access to the T objects (which are G4String objects,
    physical volume name(s) in this case) that have been set.
  o sources.make: Added:
    G4TrajectoryDrawByTouchedVolume.hh
    G4TrajectoryTouchedVolumeFilter.hh
    G4TrajectoryDrawByTouchedVolume.cc
    G4TrajectoryTouchedVolumeFilter.cc
- G4TrajectoryDrawByOriginVolume.cc: Tidied.

26th January 2016  John Allison  (modeling-V10-02-01)

- G4TrajectoryDrawByOriginVolume::Draw and
  G4TrajectoryOriginVolumeFilter::Evaluate:
  Added specific arguments to LocateGlobalPointAndSetup to handle
  multithreading mode.

  o Replaced an assignment by a reference.

19th May 2015  Laurent Garnier  (modeling-V10-01-02)
- G4PhysicalVolumeSearchScene: Optimize ProcessVolume() by 
  o setting variables only if needed
  o comparing string lenght before comparing all string

7th March 2015  John Allison  (modeling-V10-01-01)
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel: Add GetCurrentTransform().
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel::CreateCurrentAttValues():

2nd February 2015  Gabriele Cosmo  (modeling-V10-01-00)
- Fix to sources.cmake script to include missing dependency on external library.

28th November 2014  John Allison  (modeling-V10-00-12)
- G4TrajectoriesModel.cc: Tidied.

29th October 2014  Makoto Asai (modeling-V10-00-11)
- G4TrajectoriesModel.cc: Further fix.

- G4TrajectoriesModel.cc: Protect against incorrect casting if G4RunManager
  base class is used in multithreaded Geant4 installation.

22nd October 2014  Laurent Garnier  (modeling-V10-00-09 require greps-V10-00-08)
- G4ModelingParameters.cc
  o Change constant in .cc nSidesMin by GetMinLineSegmentsPerCircle() in the G4VisAttribute

22nd October 2014  John Allison  (modeling-V10-00-08)
- G4TrajectoriesModel.cc: Get appropriate run manager in MT mode.

11th August 2014  John Allison  (modeling-V10-00-07)

9th July 2014  John Allison  (modeling-V10-00-06)
- G4AxesModel: Added a parameter for text size.  (Default 10 pixels.)
- G4TrajectoryDrawerUtils.cc and G4TouchableDumpScene.cc:
  o Fixed small memory leak.  (AttValues must be deleted by the user
    after use.)

19th May 2014  John Allison  (modeling-V10-00-05)
- Introduced G4TouchableDumpScene.
- Introduced G4PseudoScene.  The following now inherit it:
  o G4PhysicalVolumeSearchScene
  o G4BoundingSphereScene
  o G4TouchableDumpScene
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel
  o Allow instantiation of an empty model via the default constructor so
    that it can be used, for example, to get the G4AttDefs.  If it
    proves to be a problem we might have to disallow it again, but it is
    unlikley to be used except by visualisation experts.  See, for example,
    /vis/list, where it is used simply to get a list of G4AttDefs
  o Introduced Abort - all further geometry traversal is stopped.  (This
    is useful in G4TouchableDumpScene - once the required touchable is found
    there is no need to continue.)
  o Tidied.

6th March 2014  John Allison  (modeling-V10-00-04)
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc:
  o More careful protection of zero pointers in constructor.

- G4PhysicalVolumeModel:
  o Augmented constructor to set sensible values of some data members,
    namely fpCurrentPV, fpCurrentLV, fpCurrentMaterial and
    fpCurrentTransform, so that CreateCurrentAttValues gives the G4Atts
    of the top volume if called without any further processing.

23rd January 2014  John Allison  (modeling-V10-00-01)
- G4TrajectoriesModel:
  o Add run ID.
  o Initialise fRunID and fEventID to -1.

13th January 2014  John Allison  (modeling-V10-00-00)
- Requires greps-V10-00-01.
- G4TrajectoryDrawByAttribute:
  o Migrated to operator<< for const reference G4AttDefs map.

- G4PhysicalVolumeModel and G4ModelingParameters:
  o Tidying. 

9th October 2012  John Allison  (modeling-V09-05-20)
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel and G4ModelingParameters:
  o Moved code for converting PVPath to the simpler version from
    G4PhysicalVolumeModel (in modeling-V09-05-19) to a new
    constructor of G4ModelingParameters::VisAttributesModifier.

9th October 2012  John Allison  (modeling-V09-05-19)
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel:
  o Added GetFullPVNameCopyNoPath, which converts fFullPVPath into a
    simpler (full) path for G4ModelingParameters and G4ViewParameters.

    by new commands, /vis/touchable/set/...

6th October 2012  John Allison  (modeling-V09-05-14)
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel:
  o Added SetBaseFullPVPath.  The base full path is the full path of the top
    physical volume (actually the full path of the mother of the top physical
    volume), so that even if a user issues "/vis/drawVolume sub-detector", the
    full path includes the base full path, i.e., the full path up to the world
    volume.
- G4PhysicalVolumeSearchScene:
  o Added GetFoundFullPVPath.
 
1st October 2012  John Allison  (modeling-V09-05-13)

10th April 2012  John Allison  (modeling-V09-05-05)
- G4CallbackModel: It ws a bad idea to delete function in destructor
  (see 7th March).  OK to delete, but catastrophe when you try to use
  it a second time, for example, when model is replaced by same model.

4th April 2012  John Allison  (modeling-V09-05-04)
- Tagged.

30th March 2012  John Allison
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc:
  o If top volume is a replica or a parameterised, only draw first one.

26th March 2012  John Allison
- G4VModel: Added Get/SetType. The sub-class should set its type,
  which could be the class name, or, in the case of G4CallBackModel,
  it could be the type of object it is coding.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel: Added GetFullPVPath.

23rd March 2012  John Allison  (modeling-V09-05-03)
- G4AxesModel: Augmented global description to allow more than one
  set of axes to be added to scene if significantly different.

7th March 2012  John Allison  (modeling-V09-05-02)

- Tagged.

30th December 2011  John Allison
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel::Validate: Searches also in parallel worlds.

// Calculates the mass of a geometry tree taking into account daughters
// up to the depth specified in the G4PhysicalVolumeModel.  Culling is
// ignored so that all volumes are seen.
//
// The calculation is quite tricky, since it involves subtracting the
// mass of that part of the mother that is occupied by each daughter and
// then adding the mass of the daughter, and so on down the heirarchy.
//
// Usage for a given G4PhysicalVolumeModel* pvModel:
//   G4PhysicalVolumeMassScene massScene;
//   massScene.EstablishSpecials (*pvModel);
//   pvModel->DescribeYourselfTo (massScene);
//   G4double volume = massScene.GetVolume();
//   G4double mass = massScene.GetMass();
//   massScene.Reset();
// See, for example, G4ASCIITreeSceneHandler::EndModeling().
- Added some access functions to G4PhysicalVolumeModel:
    GetTopPhysicalVolume, GetRequestedDepth, SetRequestedDepth.

23rd February 2002  John Allison (vis-V04-00-02)
- Removed Begin/EndPrimitives from G4HitsModel and
  G4TrajectoriesModel.  This was causing nested calls to
  Begin/EndPrimitives (and thus to glNewList/EndList in OpenGL stored
  mode), since the trajectories and hits Draw methods themselves have
  Begin/EndPrimitives.

24th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-13)
