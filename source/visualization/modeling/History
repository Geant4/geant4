19 November 2019 Gabriele Cosmo (modeling-V10-05-11)
- Fixed more cases of implicit type conversions.

15 November 2019 Gabriele Cosmo (modeling-V10-05-10)
- Fixed cases of implicit type conversions from size_t to G4int.

19 September 2019  Makoto Asai (modeling-V10-05-09)
- G4PSHitsModel.cc
  o Namespace scope is added to MeshScoreMap
  o Co-working with detutils-V10-05-01

29 August 2019  John Allison (modeling-V10-05-08)
- Part of vis-V10-05-24.
- Add G4TessellatedSolid to list of solids that may be specially treated

16 July 2019  John Allison  (modeling-V10-05-07)
- Part of vis-V10-05-22.
- G4CallbackModel.hh:
  o Include modelling parameters in passed arguments.

05 July 2019  John Allison  (modeling-V10-05-06)
- Part of vis-V10-05-21.
- Rationalise trajectory line drawing.
  o There is a flag - DrawLine - which controls whether a trajectory
    should be drawn at all:
      /vis/modeling/trajectories/drawByCharge-0/default/setDrawLine 
    but there is also a lineVisible command, which should do the same.:
      /vis/modeling/trajectories/drawByCharge-0/default/setLineVisible
    This is fixed in this tag.
  o I think there was some confusion between "visible" as used by filtering
    and "visible" as used in drawing. For example in
      G4TrajectoryDrawByCharge::Draw
      (const G4VTrajectory& traj, const G4bool& /*visible*/)
    the argument visible is the former sense but it is (was) interpreted as
    visible in the latter sense. As you see, I have suppressed its use in
    this and similar functions.

13 June 2019  John Allison  (modeling-V10-05-04)
- Part of vis-V10-05-20.
- G4ModelingParameters:
  o Add cloud to enum options and updated operators != and <<:
  o Similarly added to VisAttributesSignifier
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc:
  o Handle new VisAttributesSignifiers.

10 June 2019  John Allison  (modeling-V10-05-03)
- Part of vis-V10-05-19.
- G4ArrowModel: Further use of const and introduce further protection.
- G4VFieldModel.cc: Further use of const.

29 May 2019  John Allison  (modeling-V10-05-02)
- Improve field modelling:
  o G4VFieldModel: Improve so even the smallest non-zero sample is visible:
    . Values < 10% max are drawn as lines of width 2.
    . Values < 1% max have their length fixed at 1% max.
    . Reverse colour code. Now, where f = fieldStrength/maxStrength:
        0 -> f/2 -> f is coded as red -> green -> blue.
      For a uniform field this means arrows are now blue instead of red.
  o G4ArrowModel:
    . Place checks on dimensions to prevent G4Exceptions in used solids.
    . Model arrow head as G4Tet.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc:
  o Improve printing from operator<< for nodeID path.

04 April 2019  John Allison  (modeling-V10-05-01)
- Co-works visman-V10-05-04.
- Final (for now) corrections to /vis/viewer/set/sectionPlane.
  Still some strange behaviour in small fraction of cases. See
  comments in G4PhysicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid around line 748.

24 March 2019  John Allison  (modeling-V10-05-00)
- Fix bug in /vis/viewer/set/sectionPlane.
  Involves using G4DisplacedSolid instead of plain G4VSolid.

18 March 2019  Gabriele Cosmo
- Included in vis-V10-05-15
- Corrected few typos comments.

24 February 2019  John Allison
- Included in vis-V10-05-13
- Add constructor to G4PhysicalVolumesSearchScene::Findings from
  G4PhysicalVolumeModel::TouchableProperties.
- Fix bug in overlap drawing of parameterised volumes.

19 February 2019  John Allison
- Included in vis-V10-05-12
- Introduced G4BoundingExtentScene. This allows one to accumulate extents
  using the newly introduced G4VisExtent::Transform and is a better way
  of determining the overall extent of a scene (or of any set of extents)
  than by the bounding sphere approach.
- G4VFieldModel, G4ElectricFieldModel, G4MagneticFieldModel:
  o Introduced volume for field.
- G4VModel: Introduced GetTransformedExtent. This calculates the extent as
  it appears to the user, based on the local extent and the transformation.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel:
  o Use G4BoundingExtentScene instead of G4BoundingSphereScene.
  o Fix bug whereby the local extent was incorrectly calculated - in fact
    it was the transformed extent. Corresponding corrections to all cases
    where the extent is needed, for example, in defining the view
    parameters, have been made in this commit.

13 February 2019  John Allison
- Included in vis-V10-05-11
- Implement /vis/set/extentForField - see visualisation/History.

08 February 2019  John Allison
- Included in vis-V10-05-09
- Fix Coverity warnings.

31 January 2019  Michael Kelsey
- Included in vis-V01-05-08

- G4VFieldModel.hh/cc: NEW intermediate base class for magnetic, electric
  and gravitational fields.  Contains all of DescribeYourselfTo() moved from
  G4MagneticFieldModel, plus a pure virtual function (GetFieldAtLocation) to
  fetch the field vector (differently by each subclass).  Constructor now
  takes two strings to let subclasses customize diagnostics and arrow labels.

- G4ElectricFieldModel:  NEW concrete class implementing GetFieldAtLocation()
  for electric field access.

- G4MagneticFieldModel:  Move all of DescribeYourselfTo() to new base class
  G4VFieldModel.  Implement old contents of "if (field) { ..." block as new
  GetFieldAtLocation() function.

29 January 2019  John Allison
- Included in vis-V10-05-06
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc:
  o If the top volume is parameterised or a replica describe only one
    of them, namely the one specified by the copy number.

26 January 2019  John Allison
- Included in vis-V10-05-06
- Fix calculation of vis extent for parameterisations. This involved
  extending G4PhysicalVolumeModel::TouchableProperties to include copy
  number and initialising the copy number in the constructor. Then in
  G4PhysicalVolumeModel::CalculateExtent solid->ComputeDimensions is
  invoked if it is a parameterised volume.
- Some minor tidying.

02 January 2019  John Allison
- Included in vis-V10-05-00.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc: Add volume count (but comment out printing).

14 November 2018  John Allison  (modeling-V10-04-18)
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc: Fix Coverity warning.

08 November 2018  John Allison  (modeling-V10-04-17)
- G4LogicalVolumeModel.cc:
  o Overlap checking now in text and drawing.

07 November 2018  John Allison  (modeling-V10-04-16)
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc:
  o Add BasePVPath to G4Atts.
  o Tidied.
- G4LogicalVolumeModel.cc:
  o Overlap checking only in text output at present.

24 October 2018  John Allison  (modeling-V10-04-15)
- G4TouchableUtils:
  o Remove FindGlobalTransform, introduce FindTouchableProperties. The
    global transform is in properties.fTouchableGlobalTransform. 
- Add G4TouchablePropertiesScene.
- Delete G4TouchableDumpScene, G4TouchableGlobalTransformScene.
- sources.cmake: Modify for above additions and deletions.
- G4PhysicalVolumesSearchScene::Matcher:
  o Improve logic and safety.
  o Add G4Exception(...JustWarning...)
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel:
  o Comment out resets at end of DescribeYourselfTo(). Shouldn't be
    necessary - they should all be maintained. In fact, zeroing the LV
    pointer is plain wrong and causes error in GetAttvalues
  o Introduce a static function GetPVNameCopyNoPath  to convert PVPath
    to PVNameCopyNoPath:
  o Add BasePVPath to G4Atts.
- G4ModelingParameters:
  o Remove constructors that take PVPath as an argument. Caused circular
    dependency with G4PhysicalVolumeModel.
- G4AxesModel: Correct exception number.

17 October 2018  John Allison  (modeling-V10-04-14)
- G4PhysicalVolumesSearchScene: Attempt fix for Windows compiler error.

15 October 2018  John Allison  (modeling-V10-04-13)
- G4PhysicalVolumesSearchScene: Add regex search.
  o Match the string with the required match. The latter can be of the form
    "/regexp/", where regexp is a regular expression (see C++ regex),
    or a plain string, in which case there must be an exact match.

8 October 2018  John Allison
- G4MagneticFieldModel: Improve global description.

6 October 2018  John Allison  (modeling-V10-04-12)
- G4TrajectoriesModel: Improve description.

11 September 2018  John Allison  (modeling-V10-04-11)
- G4VisTrajContext.cc: Initialise fLineWidth(1.).

10 September 2018  John Allison  (modeling-V10-04-10)
- Add G4PhysicalVolumesSearchScene.
  o This returns all occurrences of a physical volume.

5 September 2018  John Allison
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel: More minor tidying.

4 September 2018  John Allison
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel: Minor tidying.

3 September 2018  John Allison  (modeling-V10-04-09)
- G4PhysicalVolumeSearchScene:
  o Remove fetch and store of unused logical volume pointer.

31 August 2018  John Allison  (modeling-V10-04-08)
- Add setLineWidth for trajectory models.

29 August 2018  John Allison  (modeling-V10-04-07)
- G4LogicalVolumeModel:
  o Add overlap checking (printing only for now).
    . Avoid multiple printing of overlaps. Print only first time for
      a given instantiation of G4LogicalVolume.
- Add G4TouchableGlobalTransformScene:
  o Return a pointer to the global transform of a touchable.
- Add G4TouchableUtils:
  o Implement G4TouchableUtils::FindGlobalTransform. (Uses
    G4TouchableGlobalTransformScene.) Typical use:
      G4ModelingParameters::PVNameCopyNoPath path;
      // Specify the complete path of the touchable by a succession of
      // name,copyNo pairs or pointer,copyNo pairs.
      path.push_back(G4ModelingParameters::PVNameCopyNo("World",0));
      path.push_back(G4ModelingParameters::PVNameCopyNo("Envelope",0));
      .. etc., until touchable completely specified
      const G4Transform3D* pGlobalTransform =
      G4TouchableUtils::FindGlobalTransform(path);

11 June 2018  John Allison  (modeling-V10-04-06)
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc: Fix Coverity warning.
  o Unnecessary check on pointer.

24 May 2018  John Allison  (modeling-V10-04-05)
- G4LogicalVolumeModel:
  o Add fCheckOverlaps flag. Calls CheckOverlaps for each G4PVPlacement.
  o Note: G4PVParameterised not coded in this tag.
- G4TrajectoryDrawByEncounteredVolume.cc,
  G4TrajectoryEncounteredVolumeFilter.cc:
  o Fix gcc-8 warnings.

30 April 2018  John Allison
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc: Colour by density: improved comments.

24 April 2018  John Allison  (modeling-V10-04-04)
- G4ModelingParameters.cc: Small bug fix.

24 April 2018  John Allison  (modeling-V10-04-03)
- Implement /vis/viewer/set/colourByDensity.

11th March 2018  John Allison  (modeling-V10-04-02)
- G4PhysicalVolumeMassScene.cc: Protect case of no material in parallel world.

19th December 2017  Gabriele Cosmo  (modeling-V10-04-01)
- Fixed self-consistency in G4AttValueFilterT header (missing #include).
  Thanks to Raphael Isemann for reporting this.

12th December 2017  John Allison  (modeling-V10-04-00)
- G4TrajectoryDrawerUtils.cc: Improvement to an informational message.

13th September 2017  John Allison  (modeling-V10-03-08)
- G4ModelingParameters.cc, G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc:
  Reverted default number of line segments per circle to 24.
  (72 lines per circle gives trouble in the Boolean Processor, so until that
  is fixed we revert to 24.)

14th May 2017  John Allison (modeling-V10-03-07)
- G4GPSModel: Added user-selectable colour.

3rd May 2017  John Allison (modeling-V10-03-06)
- Needs event-V10-03-01.
- Completed G4GPSModel for visualisation of General Particle Source. Can
  be used with command /vis/scene/add/gps.

3rd May 2017  John Allison (modeling-V10-03-05)
- Added prototype/skeleton G4GPSModel.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel::Validate:
  o Check world pointer (can be null if geometry has been cleared/destroyed).

19th April 2017  John Allison (modeling-V10-03-01)
- Added G4ModelingParameters::PVPointerCopyNo.

9th December 2016  John Allison (modeling-V10-03-00)
- Coworks with visman-V10-03-00.
- G4MagneticFieldModel: Augmented to take lineSegmentsPerCircle.
  Default is 6 for rapid yet adequate drawing, but this my be changed
  with /vis/set/arrow3DLineSegmentsPerCircle.

3rd November 2016  John Allison (modeling-V10-02-17)
- G4ModelingParameters and G4PhysicalVolumeModel:
  Changed default number of line segments per circle from 24 to 72.

2nd November 2016  John Allison (modeling-V10-02-16)
- G4ArrowModel: Default lines per circle = 6.
  But... there is no way to change this at run time with a
  UI command.  The following commands would have to be augmented:
    /vis/scene/add/arrow
    /vis/scene/add/axes
    /vis/scene/add/magneticField
  or a new general command added such as
    /vis/set/arrowLineSegmentsPerCircle

29th September 2016  John Allison (modeling-V10-02-15)
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel:
  o Delayed creation of modifiedVisAtts so that not created at all
    if there are no vis attributes modifiers.
  o Added std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& os,
    const std::vector<G4PhysicalVolumeModel::G4PhysicalVolumeNodeID>& path)
  o Modified so path can be copied and pasted into
   /vis/set/touchable command:
    std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& os,
    const G4PhysicalVolumeModel::G4PhysicalVolumeNodeID& node)

19th September 2016  John Allison (modeling-V10-02-14)
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc:
  o Used static to ensure a plausible vis attributes pointer.
    Note: G4VSceneHandler::PreAddSolid requires a G4VisAttributes
    object, so we have to provide one - we choose the default
    G4VisAttributes if no other is specified.

19th September 2016  John Allison (modeling-V10-02-13)
- Moved Vis Attributes Modifiers (VAMs) back from G4ViewParameters,
  reversing modeling-V10-02-11.
- Reversed modeling-V10-02-12.

12th September 2016  John Allison (modeling-V10-02-12)
- G4ModelingParameters.cc:
  o Changed output of 
    std::ostream& operator <<
    (std::ostream& os, const G4ModelingParameters::PVNameCopyNoPath& path)
    to correspond to arguments of /vis/set/touchable.

11th September 2016  John Allison (modeling-V10-02-11)
- G4ModelingParameters:
  o Removed Vis Attributes Modifiers (VAMs).
  o VAMs are now entirely in G4ViewParameters and dealt with
    in G4VViewer::GetApplicableVisAttributes.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc: Removed VAM code.

8th September 2016  John Allison
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc: Commented out VAM code.

31st August 2016  John Allison (modeling-V10-02-10)
- Co-works greps-V10-02-05.
- G4PseudoScene.hh:
  o Added
      void AddSolid (const G4Orb&);
      void AddSolid (const G4Ellipsoid&);
    to conform to greps-V10-02-05.
  o Tidied.
- G4PhysicalVolumeMassScene:
  o Changed to inherit G4PseudoScene.
  o Changed AccrueMass to ProcessVolume to conform to G4PseudoScene.
  o Added
      void AddSolid (const G4Orb&);
      void AddSolid (const G4Ellipsoid&);
    to conform to greps-V10-02-05.
  o Tidied.

14th August 2016  John Allison  (modeling-V10-02-07)
- G4TrajectoriesModel::DescribeYourselfTo:
  o Return if run or event not found.

7th August 2016  John Allison  (modeling-V10-02-06 needs greps-V10-02-02)
- G4ModelingParameters:
  o Added changes in Vis Att Modifiers for new flag IsForceDrawingStyle.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel:
  o Takes account of new flag IsForceDrawingStyle.

20th July 2016  John Allison  (modeling-V10-02-05)
- Introduced drawing and filtering by encountered volume.  I.e.,
    /vis/modeling/trajectories/create/drawByEncounteredVolume
    /vis/filtering/trajectories/create/encounteredVolumeFilter
  and their associated commands.  They replace the TouchedVolume
  commands introduced in modeling-V10-02-02.

2nd May 2016  John Allison  (modeling-V10-02-04)
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc: Fixed gcc-6.1 warning.

5th April 2016  John Allison  (modeling-V10-02-03)
- G4TrajectoryDrawByOriginVolume.cc: Tidied #include statements.

15th February 2016  John Allison  (modeling-V10-02-02)
- Introduced drawing and filtering by touched volume.  I.e.,
    /vis/modeling/trajectories/create/drawByTouchedVolume
    /vis/filtering/trajectories/create/touchedVolumeFilter
  and their associated commands.  Note that this
  selects only by a single string, the physical volume name.  If there
  are more than one physical volumes with that name then any trajectory
  touching any one of those volumes will be selected.  If the user sets
  more than one physical volume name (by using the set command more than
  once) the trajectory will be selected if it touches either of those
  volumes and which of the attributes (e.g., colour) associated with
  those volumes is chosen is undefined, but one will be chosen.
  A more comprehensive facility would allow the user to select by
  touched touchable, i.e., by the full path and copy numbers of the
  physical volume - but that is a job for the future if a use case arises.
  o G4TrajectoryModelFactories.hh/cc:
    Added G4TrajectoryDrawByTouchedVolumeFactory.
  o G4TrajectoryFilterFactories.hh/cc:
    Added G4TrajectoryTouchedVolumeFilterFactory.
  o Added new files and classes:
    G4TrajectoryDrawByTouchedVolume.hh/cc
    G4TrajectoryTouchedVolumeFilter.hh/cc  
  o G4ModelColourMap.hh: Added new access function:
    const std::map<T, G4Colour>& GetBasicMap() const;
    to allow access to the T objects (which are G4String objects,
    physical volume name(s) in this case) that have been set.
  o sources.make: Added:
    G4TrajectoryDrawByTouchedVolume.hh
    G4TrajectoryTouchedVolumeFilter.hh
    G4TrajectoryDrawByTouchedVolume.cc
    G4TrajectoryTouchedVolumeFilter.cc
- G4TrajectoryDrawByOriginVolume.cc: Tidied.

26th January 2016  John Allison  (modeling-V10-02-01)
- G4ModelingParameters.hh: Added VisAttributesModifier Set commands.

26th January 2016  John Allison  (modeling-V10-02-00)
- G4TrajectoryDrawByOriginVolume::Draw and
  G4TrajectoryOriginVolumeFilter::Evaluate:
  Added specific arguments to LocateGlobalPointAndSetup to handle
  multithreading mode.

2nd October 2015  John Allison  (modeling-V10-01-05)
- G4MagneticFieldModel.cc: Cosmetic improvements.

1st October 2015  John Allison  (modeling-V10-01-04)

- Added "light" representation to G4MagneticFieldModel.

30th July 2015  John Allison  (modeling-V10-01-03)
- G4PhysicalVolumeSearchScene.cc: Minor improvement.
  o Replaced an assignment by a reference.

19th May 2015  Laurent Garnier  (modeling-V10-01-02)
- G4PhysicalVolumeSearchScene: Optimize ProcessVolume() by 
  o setting variables only if needed
  o comparing string lenght before comparing all string

7th March 2015  John Allison  (modeling-V10-01-01)
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel: Add GetCurrentTransform().
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel::CreateCurrentAttValues():
  o Add local (and keep global) transformation.
- G4TouchableDumpScene.cc: Add polyhedron dump.

2nd February 2015  Gabriele Cosmo  (modeling-V10-01-00)
- Fix to sources.cmake script to include missing dependency on external library.

28th November 2014  John Allison  (modeling-V10-00-12)
- G4TrajectoriesModel.cc: Tidied.

29th October 2014  Makoto Asai (modeling-V10-00-11)
- G4TrajectoriesModel.cc: Further fix.

27th October 2014  Makoto Asai (modeling-V10-00-10)
- G4TrajectoriesModel.cc: Protect against incorrect casting if G4RunManager
  base class is used in multithreaded Geant4 installation.

22nd October 2014  Laurent Garnier  (modeling-V10-00-09 require greps-V10-00-08)
- G4ModelingParameters.cc
  o Change constant in .cc nSidesMin by GetMinLineSegmentsPerCircle() in the G4VisAttribute

22nd October 2014  John Allison  (modeling-V10-00-08)
- G4TrajectoriesModel.cc: Get appropriate run manager in MT mode.

11th August 2014  John Allison  (modeling-V10-00-07)
- Corrected date. modeling-V10-00-06 should be August.

9th July 2014  John Allison  (modeling-V10-00-06)
- G4AxesModel: Added a parameter for text size.  (Default 10 pixels.)
- G4TrajectoryDrawerUtils.cc and G4TouchableDumpScene.cc:
  o Fixed small memory leak.  (AttValues must be deleted by the user
    after use.)

19th May 2014  John Allison  (modeling-V10-00-05)
- Introduced G4TouchableDumpScene.
- Introduced G4PseudoScene.  The following now inherit it:
  o G4PhysicalVolumeSearchScene
  o G4BoundingSphereScene
  o G4TouchableDumpScene
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel
  o Allow instantiation of an empty model via the default constructor so
    that it can be used, for example, to get the G4AttDefs.  If it
    proves to be a problem we might have to disallow it again, but it is
    unlikley to be used except by visualisation experts.  See, for example,
    /vis/list, where it is used simply to get a list of G4AttDefs
  o Introduced Abort - all further geometry traversal is stopped.  (This
    is useful in G4TouchableDumpScene - once the required touchable is found
    there is no need to continue.)
  o Tidied.

6th March 2014  John Allison  (modeling-V10-00-04)
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc:
  o More careful protection of zero pointers in constructor.

26th January 2014  John Allison  (modeling-V10-00-02)
- GNUmakefile: Added dependency on run category.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel:
  o Augmented constructor to set sensible values of some data members,
    namely fpCurrentPV, fpCurrentLV, fpCurrentMaterial and
    fpCurrentTransform, so that CreateCurrentAttValues gives the G4Atts
    of the top volume if called without any further processing.

23rd January 2014  John Allison  (modeling-V10-00-01)
- G4TrajectoriesModel:
  o Add run ID.
  o Initialise fRunID and fEventID to -1.

13th January 2014  John Allison  (modeling-V10-00-00)
- Requires greps-V10-00-01.
- G4TrajectoryDrawByAttribute:
  o Migrated to operator<< for const reference G4AttDefs map.

  Coworks with tag "geom-specific-V09-06-22".

30th September 2013  John Allison  (modeling-V09-06-19)
- Re-tagged after clean-up by Gunter and Mke.

27th September 2013  Michael Kelsey (modeling-V09-06-18)
- G4MagneticFieldModel.hh:  Remove expanded '$'Id'$' value and re-commit to
  (hopefully!) synchronize SVN state and eliminate "Modified" warnings in
  CDash.

21st September 2013  John Allison  (modeling-V09-06-17)
- G4MagneticFieldModel: Fix compiler warnings.

20th September 2013  John Allison  (modeling-V09-06-16)
- G4MagneticFieldModel: Added '$'Id'$' functionality.

2nd September 2013  John Allison

22nd November 2005  John Allison (modeling-V07-01-03)
- Implemented radial replicas for G4Tubs.
- Changed G4Transform3D::Identity to G4Transform3D().

24th October 2005  John Allison (modeling-V07-01-02)
- Added: G4VTrajectoryModel, G4VTrajectoryModelMaker, G4TrajectoryModelMaker
  and G4TrajectoryTestModel.
- G4VModel: cosmetic changes.

13th October 2005  John Allison (modeling-V07-01-01)
- Migrated to <sstream>.

13th September 2005  John Allison (modeling-V07-01-00)
- Fixed (non-)culling of transparent volumes.

7th June 2005  John Allison (modeling-V07-00-02)
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel: fixed case of off-origin volume.
- G4TextModel: Further small improvement.

31st May 2005  John Allison  (modeling-V07-00-01)
- G4TextModel: Improved global tag for better identification.

6th May 2005  John Allison  (modeling-V07-00-00)
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel: SetCopyNo of replicas and paramaterised volumes.

3rd March 2005  John Allison  (vis-V07-00-08)
- Added Set methods to G4VModel.
- Added argument to G4CallbackModel::operator()(const G4Transform3D&) so that
  the model could implement a given transformation.  Provided default for
  G4VUserVisAction::(const G4Transform3D& = G4Transform3D::Identity).

11th November 2004  John Allison  (vis-V06-02-05)
- Made use use of smart method GetPolyhedron for solids.  This greatly
  speeds 2nd and subsequent drawings when kernel access is required.

22nd September 2004  John Allison  (modeling-V06-02-01)
- Changed use of deprecated G4VPhysicalVolume::GetRotation to GetRotationValue.
- Fixed memory leak in G4PhysicalVolumeMassScene.

13th September 2004  John Allison  (modeling-V06-02-00)
- Added G4PhysicalVolumeMassScene.  From the header file:
// Calculates the mass of a geometry tree taking into account daughters
// up to the depth specified in the G4PhysicalVolumeModel.  Culling is
// ignored so that all volumes are seen.
//
// The calculation is quite tricky, since it involves subtracting the
// mass of that part of the mother that is occupied by each daughter and
// then adding the mass of the daughter, and so on down the heirarchy.
//
// Usage for a given G4PhysicalVolumeModel* pvModel:
//   G4PhysicalVolumeMassScene massScene;
//   massScene.EstablishSpecials (*pvModel);
//   pvModel->DescribeYourselfTo (massScene);
//   G4double volume = massScene.GetVolume();
//   G4double mass = massScene.GetMass();
//   massScene.Reset();
// See, for example, G4ASCIITreeSceneHandler::EndModeling().
- Added some access functions to G4PhysicalVolumeModel:
    GetTopPhysicalVolume, GetRequestedDepth, SetRequestedDepth.
- Protected GetPhysicalVolumeModel when all volumes "invisible".

12th November 2003  John Allison  (modeling-V05-02-02)
- CalculateExtent always searches complete hierarchy.

6th November 2003  John Allison  (modeling-V05-02-01, vis-V05-02-03)
- GNUmakefile: rationalised.

3rd November 2003  Gabriele Cosmo  (modeling-V05-02-00, vis-V05-02-02)
- Added inclusion of G4VSolid.hh in G4LogicalVolumeModel.cc to make it self
  consistent after header review in geometry category.

4th October 2003  Gabriele Cosmo  (vis-V05-02-01)
- GNUmakefile:
  o added dependency to new module "geometry/navigation".
  o replaced "digits+hits" with "digits_hits".
- Coworks with "geometry-V05-02-00" and "digits_hits-V05-02-00".

22nd September 2003  John Allison  (vis-V05-02-00, greps-V05-02-00)
- Removed a redundant comment.

20th November 2002  Gabriele Cosmo  (modeling-V04-01-00)
- Fixed access to static data (requires "greps-V04-01-04") in
  G4FlavoredParallelWorldModel.cc, to allow porting on Windows DLLs.

11th November 2002  John Allison  (modeling-V04-00-00)
- Added fDrawingMode data member to G4TrajectoriesModel.

24th October 2002  John Allison (vis-V04-01-03)
- Changes for AddThis(const G4VTrajectory&) and (const G4VHit&).

23rd February 2002  John Allison (vis-V04-00-02)
- Removed Begin/EndPrimitives from G4HitsModel and
  G4TrajectoriesModel.  This was causing nested calls to
  Begin/EndPrimitives (and thus to glNewList/EndList in OpenGL stored
  mode), since the trajectories and hits Draw methods themselves have
  Begin/EndPrimitives.

24th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-13)
- Intoduced argument for printing in G4VModel::Validate(G4bool warn).
- Changed default return value in G4VModel::Validate(G4bool) to true.
- Invoke CalculateExtent after successful geometry change in
  G4PhysicalVolumeModel::Validate, and other bug fixes..

14th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-11)
- Added sceneHandler.Begin/EndPrimitives messages to models (long
  standing bug!).

9th August 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-02-10-00)
- Removed G4ModelingParameters::hierarchy.  It is no longer used.  The
  textual or graphical representation of the geometry hierarchy is now
  done in G4xxxTree classes in visua;ization/Tree.

25th July 2001  John Allison  (modeling-V03-02-03)
- Added G4VModel::GetG4PhysicalVolumeModel().
- Added G4VModel* argument to G4BoundingSphereScene constructor.
  Both the above are to facilitate access to a model, if it exists, and
  to invoke methods of G4PhysicalVolumeModel if it is one.
- Added code to curtail G4PhysicalVolumeModel search in G4BoundingSphereScene.

24th July 2001  John Allison  (modeling-V03-02-02)
- Added G4VModel::SetExtent(const G4VisExtent&).
- Cosmetic improvements to G4BoundingSphereScene.
- Augmented G4ScaleModel::fGlobalTag.

21st July 2001  John Allison  (modeling-V03-02-01)
- Added G4ScaleModel.
- Fixed bug in G4BoundingSphereScene::::Accrue().
- Also a few cosmetic changes.

18th July 2001  John Allison  (modeling-V03-02-00)
- Ensured rotation and translation of replica is restored.

3rd February 2001  John Allison  (vis-V03-00-02)
- Tidied for CodeWizard.

29th May 2000  John Allison
- Moved code for maintaining depth, physical and logical volume
  pointers from VisitGeometryAndGetVisReps to DescribeAndDescend to
  handle daughters of replicas correctly (Guy Barrand).

22nd May 2000  John Allison  (modeling-V01-01-00)
- Added G4VTreeGraphicsScene (DTREE).
- Commented out pVPV->SetCopyNo(n) on Makoto's advice in
  G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc.

vis-V01-01-01  12th April 2000  John Allison
- Made G4PhysicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid virtual.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid no longer deals with composite
  solids - now programmed into CompositeSolid::CreatePolyhedron, where
  CompositeSolid means G4IntersectionSolid, G4SubtractionSolid and
  G4UnionSolid.
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid no longer deals with displaced
  solids - now programmed into G4DisplacedSolid::CreatePolyhedron.
- Added G4LogicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid, which explicitly adds
  components of composite solids as white forced-wireframe objects.

vis-V00-01-10  25th November 1999  John Allison
- Adapted header files of modeling for Software Reference Manual.
