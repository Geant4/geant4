  makefiles, gmake all will build everything, including the external libraries.
  gmake all from the top-level makefile will additionally build both example
  executables as well as rztog4. From the example directory, gmake all will 
  build the external libraries, the libG3toG4.a and libG3toG4.a libraries,
  and the example executable executable.
- G4makevol.cc: added commented-out #include "G4BREPSolidPCone.hh" and

g3tog4-00-04-02 06-Mar-1998 Bill Lockman
- Modified example and test GNUmakefiles to synch with latest G4 mods (mainly
  vis and G4PhysicsList)
- test/clGeometry.cc use new method for instantiating vis manager
- broke off g3tog4DetectorConstruction executable code into .cc
- added g3tog4RunAction from test_skeleton
- added g3tog4PhysicsList from test_skeleton, dumped Process- and ParticleList
- updated example/GNUmakefile and cltog4.cc to synch with latest G4 changes

30th January 1998  Gabriele Cosmo (g3tog4-00-03-02)
- Modified order of link in test/GNUmakefile (G4intercoms)

27th January 1998  John Allison
- Simplyfied include GNUmakfile.G4VIS_USE in test/GNUmakefile.
- New way of instantiating G4VisManager in test/src/clGeometry.cc.

20-Jan-1998  Bill Lockman
- GNUmakefile: in 'ext', do only geometry (BREPS) and visualization (global)
- example/GNUmakefile: remove include GNUmakefile.common, replace with required
	rules. Do not use default clean rule - it removes the $G4SYSTEM soft 
	links
- test/GNUmakefile: remove include GNUmakefile.common, replace with required
	rules. Do not use default clean rule - it removes the $G4SYSTEM soft 
	links
- test/clGeometry.g4macro: modified
- test/include/g3tog4DetectorConstruction.hh: modified a comment
- test/src/clGeometry.cc: added an optional 3rd argument, a terminal type
- test/src/g3tog4PrimaryGeneratorAction.cc: changed some gun defaults

22-Dec-1997  Bill Lockman
added example/src, moved cltog4.cc there. Cleaned up g3tog4 makefiles.

20-Dec-1997  John Allison:
Changed ifdef OPENGL_WIDGET to ifdef G4VIS_USE_OPENGLXM in test/GNUmakefile.
Also eliminated LOADLIBS += -lGLw.  (GLw is not used, I think.)
(These flags need tidying in all GNUmakefiles -JA)

g3tog4-00-02-03 12-Dec-1997 Lockman:
test/GNUmakefile: visualization code and library path cloned from run/example2.
test/src/clGeometry: added #include "G4VisRegisterGraphicsSystems.icc"; 
protect all visualization code inside #ifdef VISUALIZE_CLGEOMETRY...#endif

18 Nov 1997 B. Lockman:
src/G4gsmate.cc: changed | to || 
src/G3gsdetv.cc: currently disable
test/src/, include: updated g3tog4*.cc and *.hh from run/example1
g3tog4.F : commented out call to code generator
Removed G3G4Init.cc, G3Mother.cc, G3Mother.hh
GNUmakefile: 	if SLAC env. variable is set, use cernlib -v 95a, otherwise 
		use pro
example/GNUmakefile: updated pattern rules to build .d.
test/GNUmakefile: remove pattern rules, replace with include GNUmakefile.common
include/G3G4Interface.hh: G4BuildGeom now returns G4LogicalVolume*
include/G3VolTable.hh: added static G4LogicalVolume* mothLV; getLVx(G4String&)
		now returns G4LogicalVolume* corresponding to a name, using 
		G4LogicalVolumeStore class; removed getTopVol method
src/G3VolTable.cc: removed G3Mother; Mother corresponds to the first volume 
		placed by G3toG4 (set by method setMother in in putLV.
src/G4BuildGeom.cc returns G4LogicalVolume* of first volume placed by G3toG4
src/G4gsatt.cc,G4gsdetv.cc,G4gsdv*.cc: replaced getLV(name) with getLVx(name)
src/G4gspos*.cc: use G4PVPlacement constructor which places volume inside
		Logical mother volume.
src/G4makevol.cc: check that LV is not already placed; if so, do not place it. 
		Removed references to G3MOther; added G3Bound to chek the
		radial bounds on PCON and PGON volumes
src/clparse.cc: removed GlobalMotherVolume and SubsystemMotherVolume logic.
src/g3tog4.F: remove ctop(G3G4Init)
test/src/g3tog4DetectorConstruction: G4LogicalVolume* G4BuildGeom; place
top-level volume.

08-Nov 1997 B. Lockman
cltog4.cc, clGeometry.cc: update to follow skeleton.cc pattern
G4makevol.cc: check parameters of PGON, PCON, adjust if necessary
tog4.F: new rz reader from Vladimir Berejnoi.

21-Jul 1997 G. Cosmo
G3toG4.hh: commented out extern declaration of min(). Porting on HP-UX10.

16-Jul 1997 B. Lockman
G3Mother.cc: set the vis attributes of the mother to be invisible
G4makevol.cc: commented out the forward declaration class G4RWTValVector<double>;

17-Jun-1997  T. Wenaus
- GNUmakefile mod to exclude g4geom.cc from library
- G3VolTable mod to add putLV(name, lvol) method for case when nothing
  other than lvol pointer is known about the volume 
- src/clparse.cc mods to use g3tog4 in the context of a Geant4
  application of which g3tog4 is just a component:
  - G4LogicalVolume* GlobalMotherVolume if non-null points to the
    global mother to be used by g3tog4
  - G4LogicalVolume* SubsystemMotherVolume is loaded with the lvol
    immediately under the g3tog4 global mother (second gsvolu definition
    during the parsing)

12-Jun-1997  B. Lockman
G3Mother.cc: set the vis attributes of the mother to be invisible

28-May-1997  B. Lockman
g3tog4/GNUmakefile : split lib into 'libf' and 'libc'
test,example/GNUmakefile : make libc target in to level makefile instead of lib
src/clGeometry.cc : made cltog4.cc a short version of clGeometry.cc

20-May-1997  B. Lockman
- test/GNUmakefile : added run to include path
- test/src/clGeometry.cc : add particle and hit generation

05-May-1997  B. Lockman
- src/clparse.cc: G3G4Init no longer calls G4Setup (G3Setup instantiates a 
  fixed-shape world volume. This is now handled in G3Mother, based on the 
  information in the call list file.) G3G4Init now just opens clparse.out.

- src/G4makevol.cc : SingletonMother->Instance(G4LogicalVolume* lvol)

- src/G4BuildGeom returns G3Vol.getPV() (see below)

- G3Mother : Singleton class whose data memebers _instance and _LV are 
  initialized from a call in G4Makevol

o src/G3Mother::Instance(G4LogicalVolume * LV) stores the pointer to the
  singleton object (_instance) and the pointer to the logical mother volume
  (_instance->_LV); places mother volume; store pointer to physcal mother 
  volume in G3VolTable: G3Vol.setMother(motherWorldPhys)

- src/G3VolTable.cc : 

o G4LogicalVolume* G3VolTable::getLV() returns the pointer to the top-level
  logical mother volume 

o G4VPhysicalVolume* G3VolTable::getPV() returns the pointer to the top-level 
  physical mother volume

- test/src/clGeometry.cc:

o geometry is now closed in G4BuildGeom when G3ggclas is called 

03-May-1997  B. Lockman
- summary : got rid of artifical top level volume, replaced with top level
  logical volume defined in call list file; place it.

- src/G3Mother.cc, include/G3Mother.hh : singleton class to hold copy of
  mother volume name. Can be accessed from anywhere

- src/G3VolTable.cc, include/G3VolTable.hh : added getTopVol(), returns a
  pointer to the top level logical volume

- src/G3makevol.cc: fill singleton class

- src/G4BuildGeom.cc: invoke getTopVol, create top level physical volume
  from logical volume, no longer done in G4Setup.

02-May-1997  B. Lockman
- src/jshape.F: translate HYPE, ELTU and CTUBS shape numbers into names
- src/G4gsdv*.cc: call G4gsvolu with zeronpars

28-Apr-1997  B. Lockman :
- example,test/GNUmakefile :
o added 'ext' target which depends on g4ext (phony) and 'all'. The former
  simply runs the 'ext' target in the top-level GNUmakefile.

25-Apr-1997  B. Lockman :
- src/G4gsdvn2.cc: fixed array overrun
- src/G4gspos, G4gsposp, G4gsvolu: fixed some small memory leaks
- src/rztog4.F : added optional second argument to specify the call list file
- src/clparse.cc : G4bool _debug (local) controls printing of each read line
- test/src/clGeometry.cc :  define world volume for tracking : G4TransportationManager::getTransportationManager()->getNavigatorForTracking()->SetWorldVolume( pGeometries );



24-Apr-1997  B. Lockman :
-test/src/clGeometry.cc:
o instantiated a geometry before G4VisManager

23-Apr-1997  B. Lockman :
- GNUmakefile: 
o added 'all' to 'ext' dependencies. gmake ext now builds all the
  needed libraries and makes the rztog4 executable. cltog4 executable is made
  by example/GNUmakefile; clGeometry executable is made by test/GNUmakefile.
o added lG4run to library list in all three GNUmakefiles
 
- src/G4gsvolu: 
o changed 'delete param' to 'delete [] param'

02-Apr-1997  B. Lockman :
- phase out GNUmakefile-ext. Replace with 'ext' target in GNUmakefile; also 
  added a 'geom' target which updates geometry/, including STEP and BREPS,
  and merges all .o files into geometry/$G4SYSTEM/libG4geometry.a. Thus:
    using         prototype/GNUmakefile      g3tog4/GNUmakefile
                  ---------------------------------------------
  either type:         "gmake"     followed by   "gmake ext"           
      or type:         "gmake vis" followed by   "gmake geom"
                  ---------------------------------------------
  where 'ext' updates particle+matter, global, interfaces, visualization and
  geometry, including BREPS and STEP,
  and 'geom' updates geometry only, including BREPS and STEP
  
- example/: added cltog4.cc, removed from src/.
07-Apr-1997  B. Lockman
- GNUmakefiles: particle+matter/GNUmakefile global target now produeces 
  libraries in particles, processes, management and materials. Modify library
  path accordingly.
- src/G4makefile: Updated to construct G4Para.

31-Mar-1997  B. Lockman :
- src/G4gsrotm.cc:
o Incorporated proper coordinate-system rotation calculated from Euler angles.
  The convention in Geant3 is to specify the roation matrix as a rotation of
  the coordinate system, not a rotation of the body, as was done in Geant3.
  The c.s. rotation matrix is the transpose of the body rotation matrix.

27-Mar-1997  B. Lockman :
- moved cltog4.cc from src to example so that it doesnt get put into g3tog4 
  library. Thus, libG3toG4.a will contain no main routine. This avoids 
  conflicts with mains in other packages (like visualization/test). Added
  GNUmakefile to example to build cltog4 target. Commented cltog4 target in
  g3tog4/GNUmakefile.

20-Mar-1997  B. Lockman :
- src/G4makevol.cc: 
o G4BREPSolidPCone, Polyhedra require the number of sections = nz -1
- GNUmakefile :
o removed -include ../global/GNUmakefile.common
o added clean_libs, clean (doesnt remove $G4SYSTEM/), clean-all (removes 
  $G4SYSTEM)
o put in libG3toG4.a target, depends on ../$(G4SYSTEM)/libG3toG4.a. Rule is to
  run ../GNUmakefile which now just makes the libraries
o typing 'gmake' will make 'all' target
  typing 'gmake lib' or 'gmake bin' will make the libraries and binaries
o remove binaries before rebuilding
- src/GLKludge.cc , include/GLKludge.hh : currently G4BREPSolidPCone and 
  G4BREPSolidPolyhedra cant handle cases where z[i] = z[i-1], add 10 microns 
  to z[i] as a temporary kludge if z[i] <= z[i-1]

19-Mar-1997  B. Lockman :
- GNUmakefile-ext:
o currently builds geometry global target using geometry/GNUmakefile.test

18-Mar-1997  B. Lockman :
- GNUmakefile-ext:
o updating of external packages needed by g3tog4 now done in 
  GNUmakefile-ext. Invoke 'global' target in packages supporting this.
  This target removes the libraries in the lower level
  package directories and consolidates them in the top-level package
  directories, simplifying the library path somewhat in GNUmakefile and 
  example/GNUmakefile. This also makes the libraries defined here 
  compatable with those defined in visualization/test/GNUmakefile.
o added a clean_libs target to remove all libraries (invoked from the command
  line; 'all' does not depend on it)
 
Mar 16 '97 TW
- GNUmakefile:
o minor typo fix CPPFLAGS -> $(CPPFLAGS)
o consolidated histories back into this file; please keep this file a
  single comprehensive history of g3tog4 package modifications.

14-Mar-1997 Lockman: 	
- GNUmakefile:
o Added vpath %.a to provide library search path
o make cltog4 dependent on all the libraries in G4LIBS

11-Mar-1997  B. Lockman :
- GNUmakefile:
o added tracking, intercoms to library path ; 
  now update BREPS, STEP, CSG targets in GNUmakefile-ext

04-Mar-1997  B. Lockman :
- GNUmakefile:
o added LDFLAGS variable to allow user to specify link options from
  from the cmd line

17-Jan-1997  B. Lockman :
- GNUmakefile:
o updated include path to include BREPS, STEP and graphics_reps.
o updated library path to include BREPS, STEP libraries
o Added phony BREPS and STEP targets to insure these packages are
  compiled (really should be done in the top-level GNUmakefile)
  
15-Jan-1997  B. Lockman :
- GNUmakefile:
o rewrote include path after directory restructuring
o rewrote library path after directory restructuring
- g3routines.F : run-time formatting of call list file implemented.
- mztog4.F, rztog4.F : put tog4 into a separate file
- tog4.F : dimensioned orig, fact to 5000


29-Oct-1996  B. Lockman :
- GNUmakefile:
o rewrote include path after directory restructuring
o rewrite library path after directory restructuring  

02-Oct-1996  B. Lockman :
- GNUmakefile:
o in making/updating libG3toG4F.a, run ranlib on this library, not 
  libG3toG4.a

01-Oct-1996  B. Lockman :
- GNUmakefile:
o modified FCFLAGS to replace -I with  -WF,-I to define cpp include 
  path for xlf compiler
o added -d option for xlf compiler to write intermediate .f file
o added -g option to produce debug symbols
o added $(fsources) (*.f filobals.hhles) to 'all' dependencies 
o moved 'all' rule to below definition of $(cernlibs) so that 
  $(fsources) is defined
o defined pattern rule to move .f files to $(G4SYSTEM)
o moved -include ../global/GNUmakefile.common after explicit rules 
  and before pattern rules definition. This file defines the
  variables $(sources) (src/*.cc) and $(dependencies) (corresponding
  .d files) as well as some pattern rules (which are redefined 
  locally)
 
Sep 24 '96 TW
- completion of handling of all cases of Indexing via individual logical
  volume objects created for each instantiation, with physical volume list
  of the instantiations kept in the G3Vol data structure and used to
  place daughters in the logical volume of each instantiation. 
  (Temporary, pending a proper G4 implementation of Indexed placement.)
- turn off geometry optimisation (takes forever for big geometries!!)

Sep 15 '96 TW
- G4Cons incorporated
- Indexed GSVOLUs via negative length parameters finished (G3CalcParamsFn
  extended)

Sep 10 '96 TW

  G3Vol structure keeps track of G4LogicalVolumes created and placed
  for G3 parametrised volume invocations. (no G4PVIndexed, originally
  foreseen)
- G4Trd implemented
- G4PVReplica, G4PVParameterised implemented
- placeholder solid eliminated; NPAR=0 cases handled as described
- cltog4 interface improved
- clparse inactive geometry calls instated; all now active
