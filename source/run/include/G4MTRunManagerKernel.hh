// class description:
//
//     This is a class for mandatory control of GEANT4 kernel.
//     This class implements Worker behavior in a MT application.
//
//     This class is constructed by G4MTRunManager. If a user uses his/her own
//     class instead of G4MTRunManager, this class must be instantiated by
//     him/herself at the very beginning of the application and must be deleted
//     at the very end of the application. Also, following methods must be
//     invoked in the proper order.
//       DefineWorldVolume
//       InitializePhysics
//       RunInitialization
//       RunTermination
//
//     User must provide his/her own classes derived from the following
//     abstract class and register it to the RunManagerKernel.
//        G4VUserPhysicsList - Particle types, Processes and Cuts
//
//     G4MTRunManagerKernel does not have any eveny loop. Handling of events
//     is managed by G4RunManager.
//
//     This class re-implements only the method that require special treatment
//     to implement worker behavior
