//  This is the abstract base class for instantiating all the user action classes.
// It has a pure virtual method Build() which is invoked by G4RunManager for
// sequential execution and G4WorkerRunManager for multi-threaded execution.
// The additional virtual method BuildForMaster() will be invoked from G4MTRunManager
// for multi-threaded execution.
//
//  Note that these virtual methods are const. It means the user may construct
// user action objects, but should not store the pointers of these objects as
// data members of the derived class.
//
// Note for multi-threaded mode:
//  The only action class the user may set to G4MTRunManager is a run action. It is
// then used at the beginning and the end of a run. It may be the same class or a
// dedicated class different from the run action instantiated for G4WorkerRunManager.
