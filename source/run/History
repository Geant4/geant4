May 5th, 2013, A.Dotti, M.Asai (run-V09-06-29)

  1. All ions are created in MT by master thread (workers copy ions table)
  2. G4VModularPhysicsList::ConstructProcess has a global mutex lock, in this
     way all worker threads call this method one at a time. This limitation is 
     needed since with many threads we have seen instabilities due to one or more
     hadronics model corrupting common shared part of physics (most likely particles
     table). Not yet found the correct solution for this problem.
