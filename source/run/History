  NEED TO FIX THIS

May 15th, 2013, M. Asai (run-V09-06-34)
- Enabling more than one runs.
- Fixing the handling of user-defined parallel worlds.

May 14th, 2013, M. Asai
- Introducing SetSensitiveDetector() method to G4VUserParallelWorld.

May 13th, 2013, A. Dotti (run-V09-06-33)
- Changed G4WorkerRunManager to use new methods. All thread-control
  method in G4UserWorkerInitialization are now public.

May 13th, 2013, M.Asai (run-V09-06-32)
- Introducing two new protected virtual methods in G4UserWorkerInitialization
  as additional user hooks.

May 7th, 2013, A. Dotti (run-V09-06-31)
- Add explicit initialization of all ions and isomers needed, for MT
  coworking with particles-V09-06-26

May 6th, 2013, M.Asai (run-V09-06-30)
- Change the default number of threads from 0 to 2.

May 5th, 2013, A.Dotti, M.Asai (run-V09-06-29)
- Adding two possibly temporary hacks for hadroncis physics instabilities
  1. All ions are created in MT by master thread (workers copy ions table)
  2. G4VModularPhysicsList::ConstructProcess has a global mutex lock, in this
     way all worker threads call this method one at a time. This limitation is
     needed since with many threads we have seen instabilities due to one or more
     hadronics model corrupting common shared part of physics (most likely particles
     table). Not yet found the correct solution for this problem.
- Introducing /run/numberOfThreads command.

May 5th, 2013, H.Kurashige (run-V09-06-28)
- 'run/particle/AddProcManager' can be used in Pre_Init state
  (requested by particles-V09-06-24 tag)

  at beginning and end of for-loop event loop
  (cfr G4WorkerRunManager::DoEventLoop and
	G4MTRunManager::InitializeEventLoop)
- Bug fixing for RNG seeds lenght. Now vector of event seeds correctly
