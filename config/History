     ----------------------------------------------------------

7th December 2000 Gabriele Cosmo (config-V02-00-12)
- Added options to SUN-CC5.gmk to handle multithreading and persistency.

5th December 2000 Youhei Morita (config-V02-00-11)
- Introduced GPPFLAGS to set -M or -MM according to G4ODBMS.

5th December 2000 Gabriele Cosmo (config-V02-00-10)
- Restored -MM option to g++ for making dependencies. -M was introduced in
  tag config-V02-00-02 to allow dependency search on system headers as well
  (#include<...> statements). This however introduces serious clashes with
  Objectivity schema generation for the persistency module.

4th December 2000 Gunter Folger (config-V02-00-09)
- Disable G4RUNPATHOPTION (internal variable) for all but SUN. This is/will 
  be used when linking with G4 shared libraries to store the path to these 
  libraries in the executable. 

1st December 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V02-00-08)
- Added G4UI_USE_TCSH and related settings to G4UI_USE.gmk (M.Maire).
- Merged SUN-CC6.gmk to SUN-CC5.gmk and removed SUN-CC6.gmk.

1st December 2000  Gunter Folger (config-V02-00-07)
- Change -M to -M -MG in common.gmk, binmake.gmk. This will output a "correct"
  dependency file even when missing  header files are missing. Correct in the
  sense that liblist will work, and that the missing header is supposed to be
  (made) in the source directory.

17th November 2000  Gunter Folger (config-V02-00-06)
- Link with CLHEP using -L/-l instead of absolute filename; this allows 
  to link with shared lib of Anaphe, or static lib of Geant4.
- Added shared-lib settings to sys configurations.

14th November 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V02-00-05)
- Added reference to new "parameterisations" top category.
  Modified files: binmake.gmk.
- Removed makeshlib.sh script, now obsolete.

7th November 2000  Guy Barrand
- analysis.gmk : renamed OpenScientist things to "Lab" ; 
  Lab is the concrete package where analysis is done.

3rd November 2000  Gunter Folger (config-V02-00-04)
- common.gmk: fix for shared-library build.
- common.gmk, globlib.gmk: added rules for "includes" gmake target.
- architecture.gmk: introduced new user settable variable G4INCLUDE
  to specify path where headers (files or symbolic-links) should be installed.

1st November 2000  Guy Barrand
- analysis.gmk: declared Lizard.

24th October 2000  Gunter Folger (config-V02-00-03)
- architecture.gmk, common.gmk, globlib.gmk, sys/*:
  o merged building shared libraries into makefiles.
    The MAKESHLIB script is no longer used.
- Introduced new variables steering the building of archive/shared libs:
   G4LIB_BUILD_SHARED
   G4LIB_BUILD_ARCHIVE  (still default)
     note that G4MAKESHLIB set will internally set G4LIB_BUILD_SHARED for
     backwards compatiblity.
- Introduced new variable (G4LIB_USE_GRANULAR) to force using of granular 
  libraries, even when libG4global.a/.so exists.

14th September 2000  Guy Barrand 
- Introduced changes to handle analysis module.
  o added analysis.gmk.
  o sys/Linux-g++.gmk: added macro DLDLIBS for library dynamic loading.
  o binmake.gmk: added inclusion of analysis.gmk.
  o binmake.gmk: place LDLIBS3 += $(ANALYSISLIBS) after LDLIBS3 += $(INTYLIBS).

22nd August 2000  John Allison (config-V02-00-02)
- Changed -MM to -M in dependency file making in binmake.gmk and common.gmk.
  This causes dependencies of both #include "..." and #include <...> to be
  followed.  This is the safer option, since some users might/should use,
  e.g., #include <g4std/...>, but even these files change sometime.

22nd August 2000  Gunter Folger
- globlib.gmk: fix for protection from infinite loops when a dir does
  not exist (G.Folger).

1st August 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V02-00-01)
- Added setup WIN32-g++ for Windows/NT/9X with Cygwin and g++ compiler.
  Configuration non officially supported (courtesy of S.Agostinelli and
  IST group, Genova).

24th July 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V02-00-00)
- Added path to g3tog4 for global libs.

23rd May 2000  John Allison (config-V01-01-04)
- Added -I$(G4BASE)/processes/hadronic/models/radiative_decay/include to
  binmake.gmk.

19th May 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V01-01-03)
- architecture.gmk:
  o changed -pic option to -KPIC for SUN architectures.
  o fixed HP-aCC setup to cope with new CLHEP version 1.5.
  o implemented modular setup. Now system specific configurations are
    grouped in separated files $G4SYSTEM.gmk and placed in the new
    directory config/sys.

7th April 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V01-01-02)
- binmake.gmk: added include path to the new directory
  geometry/solids/specific.
- Updated PERL script g4step_correct.pl for parsing STEP files.

30th March 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V01-01-01)
- makeshlib.sh:
  o added few corrections to the script in order to allow
    creation of shared libraries without need of the static archive on
    platforms which allow this.
  o added section for SunOS systems.
  (courtesy of I.G.Caballero)
- architecture.gmk:
  o on SUN-CC and SUN-CC5, added -pic to CXXFLAGS for building shared
    libraries.

21st March 2000  Gabriele Cosmo
- makeshlib.sh: corrected invokation of compiler for HP-aCC setup.
  Changed CC to aCC (fixes bug-report #68).

13th March 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V01-01-00)
- architecture.gmk: corrected FCLIBS for Linux-g++
  o added -lg2c -lnsl and removed -lf2c.

14th February 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V01-00-02)
- architecture.gmk: added option '+W823' to HP-aCC compilation setup to
  discard warnings for macros parameter definition as used in the new
  NIST STEP reader.
- binmake.gmk: moved $EXTRALIBS to be included on top of the linking list,
  just after the user application library.

31st January 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V01-00-01)
- Added control for the Ray-tracer driver. Introduced G4VIS_USE_RAYTRACER
  in G4VIS_USE.gmk and G4VIS_BUILD_RAYTRACER_DRIVER in G4VIS_BUILD.gmk (M.Asai).
- binmake.gmk: fixed dependency order for compound libraries.
  Moved -lG4particles and -lG4materials downstream in the list.
- architecture.gmk: added G4NO_OPTIMISE for allowing compilation without
  any level of optimisation or debug. G4DEBUG if defined takes precedence.
  G4DEBUG and G4OPTIMISE are now defined also as CPPFLAGS.

3rd January 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V01-00-00)
- Syncronized with HEAD.

16th December 1999  John Allison
- Cosmetic improvement to echo line in binmake.gmk.

3rd December 1999  Youhei Morita
- common.gmk: fixed minor typo in G4OODDLX_SCHEMA_NAME

1st December 1999  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V00-01-15)
- architecture.gmk:
  o added new G4SYSTEM flavor SUN-CC5, used for testing on the new C++
    compiler v5.0 on SunOS. Requires ISO/ANSI-C++ installation and native
    STL by default. Compatibility with old no ISO/ANSI code is assured
    through the -compat compiler option and the usage of ObjectSpace STL
    (i.e. G4USE_OSPACE set).
  o added new flag G4NO_STD_NAMESPACE.
    HP-aCC setup with native STL assumes the ISO-ANSI installation by default,
    the new flag should be explicitly set in the environment to avoid this.
  o upgraded SGI-CC setup to IRIX 6.5.5, CC 7.2.1 and ObjectSpace STL.
    Tests on this configuration has NOT been tested though.

- common.gmk: changed G4SCHEMA_HEADER_DIR from G4TMPSCHEMA_INCLUDE to G4TMPDIR
              added target install_schema for schema copying
- globlib.gmk: create schema header files at G4TMPDIR, then install

29th November 1999  John Allison
- Introduced LDLIBS2EXTRA so that granular libraries are not
  expanded too soon.

25th November 1999  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V00-01-14)
- architecture.gmk: redefined OSPACEDIR as OSPACE_BASE_DIR to conform to
  an omogeneous format. Added existence check for OSPACE and CLHEP paths.

23rd November 1999  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V00-01-13)
- architecture.gmk: added setup for ISO/ANSI installation on DEC-cxx.
  If using native STL (i.e. G4USE_OSPACE not set), G4USE_STD_NAMESPACE is
  implicitly defined and a strict-ANSI installation is assumed. Note that
  in this case, also CLHEP must have been installed in strict-ANSI mode.

20th November 1999  Youhei Morita (config-V00-01-12)
- common.gmk: added G4OODDLX_SCHEMA_NAME to use Geant4 named schema

- globlib.gmk: moved contruction of libmap for G4ODBMS to
               source/GNUmakefile

- common.gmk: Surpress verbose output for G4ODBMS if CPPVERBOSE 
              is not defined.
