  o Updated list of supported systems/compilers.
- binmake.gmk:
  o Include path and library for g3tog4 module only if G4USE_G3TOG4 is defined.
    Implies proper handling of G4USE_G3TOG4 in source/GNUmakefile.

10th December 2001 Gabriele Cosmo (config-V03-02-15)
- architecture.gmk:
  o updated list of supported compilers
  o removed obsolete setup for STL ObjectSpace and STLport for Win/VC++.
- binmake.gmk: activated mechanism for using $G4INCLUDE effectively for
  building examples/applications. Currently activated only for global compound
  libraries; for granular libraries it requires re-engineering of liblist,
  feature which will be added in future.
  This mechanism allows to considerably reduce the compilation/linking command
  length and the number of -I options fed to the compiler.
- Added G4PROFILE options to Linux-g++ and Linux-egcs setups.

  new hadronic models for cascade, CHIPS and coherent_elastic.
  Does not include changes to analysis.gmk.

19th November 2001 Guy Barrand
- analysis.gmk : then remove all system specifc flags, have
   only the AIDA ones. Have G4ANALYSIS_USE to drive the insertion of 
   CPP and libs in the Geant4 GNUmakefile system.

19th November 2001  John Allison  (config-V03-02-11)
- Does not include Guy's changes of 16rd November.
- Re-instated creation of CPPFLAGS (see 6th November) but conditonal
  on existence of corresponding environment variable.  If no environmet
  variable is set, CPPFLAGS += -DG4UI_USE_TERMINAL.

16rd November 2001  Guy Barrand
- analysis.gmk : add flags to use an AIDA 2.2 compliant analysis system.

6th November 2001  John Allison  (config-V03-02-10)
- Removed CPPFLAGS += -DG4UI_USE_GAG -DG4UI_USE_TCSH -DG4UI_USE_TERMINAL.

6th November 2001  John Allison  (config-V03-02-09)

  needed by vis-V03-02-15.

23rd October 2001  Gabriele Cosmo  (config-V03-02-08)
- Merged changes in "config-V03-02-07" for removal of STLInterface.

22nd October 2001  Gabriele Cosmo  (config-V03-02-06b)
- binmake.gmk: added include path for geometry/verification

1st October 2001  Gabriele Cosmo  (config-V03-02-06a)
- binmake.gmk: removed include path for processes/electromagnetic/integral
  according to tag "em-V03-02-02".

30th September 2001  Gabriele Cosmo  (config-V03-02-07)
- Removed references to STLInterface module in architecture.gmk
  and architecture setups. Coworks with tag "global-V03-02-03" where
  STLInterface module has been removed.

29th August 2001  John Allison/Joseph Perl  (config-V03-02-06)
- Needed by vis-V03-02-14.
- First developers release of HepRep graphics driver.

27th August 2001  John Allison
- Tidied HepRep configuration in G4VIS*, moving stuff to interactivity.gmk.

24th August 2001  Joseph Perl  (config-V03-02-05)
- Introduced HepRep graphics driver

11th August 2001  John Allison  (config-V03-02-04)
- Re-engineered G4UI variables.  Coworks with interfaces-V03-02-00.
- Introduced environment variable G4UI_NONE that, if set, no UI
  sessions nor any UI libraries are built, not even libG4UIbasic.a nor
  libG4UIcommon.a.  (This would only happen in a pure batch job or,
  perhaps, in a user framework having its own UI system.)
- Removed the need to specify environment variables for UI sessions
  which do not need external packages or libraries, namely :
    G4UI_BUILD_GAG_SESSION
    G4UI_BUILD_TERMINAL_SESSION
  with associated G4UI_USE environment variables:
    G4UI_USE_GAG
    G4UI_USE_TCSH
    G4UI_USE_TERMINAL
  In other words, the above environment variables become redundant and are
  ignored.  
  For backwards compatibility, unless G4UI_NONE is set, the corresponding
  G4UI_USE C-pre-processor variables are automatically set.  Also, the
  C-pre-processor variables G4UI_BUILD and G4UI_USE are set.
- As before, environment variables for other sessions still need positive
  setting of their G4UI_BUILD and G4UI_USE environment variables.  In this
  category are:
    G4UI_BUILD_WIN32_SESSION
    G4UI_BUILD_WO_SESSION
    G4UI_BUILD_XAW_SESSION
    G4UI_BUILD_XM_SESSION
  with associated G4UI_USE environment variables:
    G4UI_USE_WIN32
    G4UI_USE_WO
    G4UI_USE_XAW
    G4UI_USE_XM
- Note: The user must still instantiate and SessionStart only *one*
  session, but if it is to be one in the category needing external
  packages or libraries, the corresponding G4UI_USE must be set to
  trigger inclusion oflibraries.  Otherwise the user need not set any
  environment variables.

3rd August 2001 Gabriele Cosmo (config-V03-02-03)
- architecture.gmk:
  o updated list of supported systems/compilers.
  o made Linux-g++ architecture the default G4SYSTEM. Replaced SUN-CC.
- Added SUN-CC4.gmk for old SUN architectures based on CC-4.2 compiler.
- Added Linux-egcs for old Linux architectures based on egcs-1.1.2 compiler.
- Made SUN-CC.gmk a copy of SUN-CC5.gmk (kept for backward compatibility,
  will be removed soon). CC-5.2 compiler is now the default on SUN systems.
- Made Linux-g++.gmk specific to gcc-2.95.2 compiler, from now on the default
  compiler on Linux systems.

1st August 2001 Gabriele Cosmo (config-V03-02-02)
- Included recent updates to scripts sources for 'Configure'.

27th July 2001  John Allison  (config-V03-02-01)
- Introduced environment variable G4VIS_NONE that, if set, no visualization
  drivers are built and no vis libraries are built, not even
  libG4vis_management.  (libG4modeling is still built.)  The C-pre-processor
  variables G4VIS_BUILD and G4VIS_USE are *not* set.
- Removed the need to specify environment variables for visualization drivers
  which do not need external packages or libraries, namely :
      G4VIS_BUILD_DAWNFILE_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_RAYTRACER_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_VRMLFILE_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_ASCIITREE_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_GAGTREE_DRIVER
    with associated G4VIS_USE environment variables:
      G4VIS_USE_DAWNFILE
      G4VIS_USE_RAYTRACER
      G4VIS_USE_VRMLFILE
      G4VIS_USE_ASCIITREE
      G4VIS_USE_GAGTREE
  In other words, the above environment variables become redundant and are
  ignored.  
  For backwards compatibility, unless G4VIS_NONE is set, the corresponding
  G4VIS_USE C-pre-processor variables are automatically set.  Also, the
  C-pre-processor variables G4VIS_BUILD and G4VIS_USE are set.
- As before, environment variables for other drivers still need positive
  setting of their G4VIS_BUILD and G4VIS_USE environment variables.  In this
  category are:
      G4VIS_BUILD_DAWN_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OPACS_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OPENGLX_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OPENGLWIN32_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OPENGLXM_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OIX_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OIWIN32_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_VRML_DRIVER
    with associated G4VIS_USE environment variables:
      G4VIS_USE_DAWN
      G4VIS_USE_OPACS
      G4VIS_USE_OPENGLX
      G4VIS_USE_OPENGLWIN32
      G4VIS_USE_OPENGLXM
      G4VIS_USE_OIX
      G4VIS_USE_OIWIN32
      G4VIS_USE_VRML
  In this case G4VIS_NONE must *not* be set.
- Added binmake.EXTRALIBS.README.

5th July 2001 Youhei Morita (config-V03-02-00)
- Linux-g++.gmk: Use -pedantic (G.Cosmo)
- Linux-g++.gmk, SUN-CC.gmk, SUN-CC5.gmk: added -DG4std in G4DDLX_FLAGS

29th June 2001 Gabriele Cosmo (config-V03-01-10)
- Updated source scripts for 'Configure'.

26th June 2001 Youhei Morita (config-V03-01-09)
- globlib.gmk: added block for copying headers for persistency in $G4INCLUDE
  when invoking the 'includes' target.

25th June 2001 Youhei Morita (config-V03-01-08)
- Restored lib_d target (again) in common.gmk with a protection of G4ODBMS.
- Linux-g++.gmk (G.Cosmo)
  o Commented out -ansi setup for public release
  o Fixed logic for activating G4OODDLX_FLAGS on egcs compiler

22nd June Gabriele Cosmo (config-V03-01-07)
- common.gmk (G.Folger):
  o removed lib_d target (again).
  o restored G4SKIP_DEPEND.
- Linux-g++.gmk:
  o added temporary cludge for identify compiler version
    and define G4DDLX_FLAGS for egcs-1.1.2.
- binmake.gmk:
  o added mechanism to correctly handle include paths when source headers
    are centrally installed in $G4INCLUDE. Temporarly disabled, requires
    update (re-design?) of liblist.c to properly generate the list of
    libraries from the map.
    Once activated, also G4UI_USE.gmk, G4VIS_USE.gmk and analysis.gmk
    have to be modified accordingly.

22nd June 2001 Youhei Morita (config-V03-01-06)
- Restored lib_d target in common.gmk with a protection of G4ODBMS.
- Get rid of G4SKIP_DEPEND in binmake.gmk.
- Comment out G4DDLX_FLAGS options in sys/Linux-g++.gmk for gcc-2.95.2.

21st June 2001 Gunter Folger (config-V03-01-05)
- Removed bin_d and lib_d targets and thus the re-start of make.

21st June 2001 Gunter Folger (config-V03-01-04)
- common.gmk, binmake.gmk: run gmake via $(MAKE).

19th June 2001 John Allison (config-V03-01-03)
- Added GAG_TREE to G4VIS_BUILD.gmk and G4VIS_USE.gmk.

20th June 2001 (Japan Time - still 19th in Europe!)
               Youhei Morita (config-V03-01-02)
- A few bug fixes in binmake.gmk, common_objy.gmk, sys/SUN-CC5.gmk,
  sys/Linux-g++.gmk, sys/Win32-g++.gmk.

19th June 2001 Gabriele Cosmo
- Removed G4_NO_CBRT flag from WIN32-VC setup. No more necessary.

30th May 2001 Gunter Folger
- Do changes for persistency from Youhei: common.gmk is now split in three,
  one general, and one for specific for transient and persistent each. 
  Dependencies now much better handled in persistency.

2nd May 2001 Gabriele Cosmo (config-V03-01-01)
- Added options "-Wall -ansi -pedantic" to Linux-g++ setup.

10th April 2001  John Allison  (config-V03-01-00)
- Added G4VIS_BUILD_ASCIITREE_DRIVER and G4VIS_USE_ASCIITREE to G4VIS*gmk.

22nd March 2001 Gunter Folger (config-V03-00-03)
- binmake.gmk, only store in executable PATH to libs from example/test; 
  other libs should be taken/found from LD_LIBRARY_PATH
- sys/{Linux-g++,SUN-CC}.gmk: enable storing of PATH to libs in executable 

06th March 2001 Gabriele Cosmo (config-V03-00-02)
- binmake.gmk: added include path for processes/electromagnetic/integral
  the new subcategory introduced with tag em-V03-00-04.

13th February 2001 Gabriele Cosmo (config-V03-00-01)
- binmake.gmk: added include path for processes/photolepton_hadron
  which was missing!

08th January 2001 Gabriele Cosmo (config-V03-00-00)
- sys/WIN32-VC.gmk: introduced -GR compiler option to allow usage of
  dynamic casting and type-info at run-time.

13th December 2000 Gunter Folger (config-V02-00-14)
- common.gmk: fix to rule for building dependencies, parsing is skip
  if $(dependencies) is empty.
- globlib.gmk: added "includes" to PHONY target list and fixed typo.
- Added comments to "includes" rules.

8th December 2000 Gabriele Cosmo (config-V02-00-13)
- Changed G4LIB_BUILD_ARCHIVE to G4LIB_BUILD_STATIC in architecture.gmk,
  common.gmk and globlib.gmk.

7th December 2000 Gabriele Cosmo (config-V02-00-12)
- Added options to SUN-CC5.gmk to handle multithreading and persistency.

5th December 2000 Youhei Morita (config-V02-00-11)
- Introduced GPPFLAGS to set -M or -MM according to G4ODBMS.

5th December 2000 Gabriele Cosmo (config-V02-00-10)
- Restored -MM option to g++ for making dependencies. -M was introduced in
  tag config-V02-00-02 to allow dependency search on system headers as well
  (#include<...> statements). This however introduces serious clashes with
  Objectivity schema generation for the persistency module.

4th December 2000 Gunter Folger (config-V02-00-09)
- Disable G4RUNPATHOPTION (internal variable) for all but SUN. This is/will 
  be used when linking with G4 shared libraries to store the path to these 
  libraries in the executable. 

1st December 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V02-00-08)
- Added G4UI_USE_TCSH and related settings to G4UI_USE.gmk (M.Maire).
- Merged SUN-CC6.gmk to SUN-CC5.gmk and removed SUN-CC6.gmk.

1st December 2000  Gunter Folger (config-V02-00-07)
- Change -M to -M -MG in common.gmk, binmake.gmk. This will output a "correct"
  dependency file even when missing  header files are missing. Correct in the
  sense that liblist will work, and that the missing header is supposed to be
  (made) in the source directory.

17th November 2000  Gunter Folger (config-V02-00-06)
- Link with CLHEP using -L/-l instead of absolute filename; this allows 
  to link with shared lib of Anaphe, or static lib of Geant4.
- Added shared-lib settings to sys configurations.

14th November 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V02-00-05)
- Added reference to new "parameterisations" top category.
  Modified files: binmake.gmk.
- Removed makeshlib.sh script, now obsolete.

7th November 2000  Guy Barrand
- analysis.gmk : renamed OpenScientist things to "Lab" ; 
  Lab is the concrete package where analysis is done.

3rd November 2000  Gunter Folger (config-V02-00-04)
- common.gmk: fix for shared-library build.
- common.gmk, globlib.gmk: added rules for "includes" gmake target.
- architecture.gmk: introduced new user settable variable G4INCLUDE
  to specify path where headers (files or symbolic-links) should be installed.

1st November 2000  Guy Barrand
- analysis.gmk: declared Lizard.

24th October 2000  Gunter Folger (config-V02-00-03)
- architecture.gmk, common.gmk, globlib.gmk, sys/*:
  o merged building shared libraries into makefiles.
    The MAKESHLIB script is no longer used.
- Introduced new variables steering the building of archive/shared libs:
   G4LIB_BUILD_SHARED
   G4LIB_BUILD_ARCHIVE  (still default)
     note that G4MAKESHLIB set will internally set G4LIB_BUILD_SHARED for
     backwards compatiblity.
- Introduced new variable (G4LIB_USE_GRANULAR) to force using of granular 
  libraries, even when libG4global.a/.so exists.

14th September 2000  Guy Barrand 
- Introduced changes to handle analysis module.
  o added analysis.gmk.
  o sys/Linux-g++.gmk: added macro DLDLIBS for library dynamic loading.
  o binmake.gmk: added inclusion of analysis.gmk.
  o binmake.gmk: place LDLIBS3 += $(ANALYSISLIBS) after LDLIBS3 += $(INTYLIBS).

22nd August 2000  John Allison (config-V02-00-02)
- Changed -MM to -M in dependency file making in binmake.gmk and common.gmk.
  This causes dependencies of both #include "..." and #include <...> to be
  followed.  This is the safer option, since some users might/should use,
  e.g., #include <g4std/...>, but even these files change sometime.

22nd August 2000  Gunter Folger
- globlib.gmk: fix for protection from infinite loops when a dir does
  not exist (G.Folger).

1st August 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V02-00-01)
- Added setup WIN32-g++ for Windows/NT/9X with Cygwin and g++ compiler.
  Configuration non officially supported (courtesy of S.Agostinelli and
  IST group, Genova).

24th July 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V02-00-00)
- Added path to g3tog4 for global libs.

23rd May 2000  John Allison (config-V01-01-04)
- Added -I$(G4BASE)/processes/hadronic/models/radiative_decay/include to
  binmake.gmk.

19th May 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V01-01-03)
- architecture.gmk:
  o changed -pic option to -KPIC for SUN architectures.
  o fixed HP-aCC setup to cope with new CLHEP version 1.5.
  o implemented modular setup. Now system specific configurations are
    grouped in separated files $G4SYSTEM.gmk and placed in the new
    directory config/sys.

7th April 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V01-01-02)
- binmake.gmk: added include path to the new directory
  geometry/solids/specific.
- Updated PERL script g4step_correct.pl for parsing STEP files.

30th March 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V01-01-01)
- makeshlib.sh:
  o added few corrections to the script in order to allow
    creation of shared libraries without need of the static archive on
    platforms which allow this.
  o added section for SunOS systems.
  (courtesy of I.G.Caballero)
- architecture.gmk:
  o on SUN-CC and SUN-CC5, added -pic to CXXFLAGS for building shared
    libraries.

21st March 2000  Gabriele Cosmo
- makeshlib.sh: corrected invokation of compiler for HP-aCC setup.
  Changed CC to aCC (fixes bug-report #68).

13th March 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V01-01-00)
- architecture.gmk: corrected FCLIBS for Linux-g++
  o added -lg2c -lnsl and removed -lf2c.

14th February 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V01-00-02)
- architecture.gmk: added option '+W823' to HP-aCC compilation setup to
  discard warnings for macros parameter definition as used in the new
  NIST STEP reader.
- binmake.gmk: moved $EXTRALIBS to be included on top of the linking list,
  just after the user application library.

31st January 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V01-00-01)
- Added control for the Ray-tracer driver. Introduced G4VIS_USE_RAYTRACER
  in G4VIS_USE.gmk and G4VIS_BUILD_RAYTRACER_DRIVER in G4VIS_BUILD.gmk (M.Asai).
- binmake.gmk: fixed dependency order for compound libraries.
  Moved -lG4particles and -lG4materials downstream in the list.
- architecture.gmk: added G4NO_OPTIMISE for allowing compilation without
  any level of optimisation or debug. G4DEBUG if defined takes precedence.
  G4DEBUG and G4OPTIMISE are now defined also as CPPFLAGS.

3rd January 2000  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V01-00-00)
- Syncronized with HEAD.

16th December 1999  John Allison
- Cosmetic improvement to echo line in binmake.gmk.

7th December 1999  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V00-01-19)
- architecture.gmk: minor fix on OSPACELIBS path for Win/NT.

5th December 1999  Youhei Morita (config-V00-01-18) 
- architecture.gmk: defined G4OODDLX_FLAGS
- common.gmk: use G4OODDLX_FLAGS

5th December 1999  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V00-01-17)
- architecture.gmk: fixes for Win/NT.

  o removed -DG4NOT_ISO_DELETES flag

3rd December 1999  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V00-01-16)
- architecture.gmk: set G4_HAVE_BOOL for SUN-CC5.

3rd December 1999  Youhei Morita
- common.gmk: fixed minor typo in G4OODDLX_SCHEMA_NAME

1st December 1999  Gabriele Cosmo (config-V00-01-15)
- architecture.gmk:
  o added new G4SYSTEM flavor SUN-CC5, used for testing on the new C++
    compiler v5.0 on SunOS. Requires ISO/ANSI-C++ installation and native
    STL by default. Compatibility with old no ISO/ANSI code is assured
    through the -compat compiler option and the usage of ObjectSpace STL
    (i.e. G4USE_OSPACE set).
  o added new flag G4NO_STD_NAMESPACE.
    HP-aCC setup with native STL assumes the ISO-ANSI installation by default,
    the new flag should be explicitly set in the environment to avoid this.
  o upgraded SGI-CC setup to IRIX 6.5.5, CC 7.2.1 and ObjectSpace STL.
    Tests on this configuration has NOT been tested though.

  implicitly defined and a strict-ANSI installation is assumed. Note that
  in this case, also CLHEP must have been installed in strict-ANSI mode.
